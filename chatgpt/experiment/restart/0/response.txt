Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine.canAddMethod()` to avoid using the deprecated method.

Before refactoring:

```java
import com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine;

public class MyClass {
    
    public void myMethod(VirtualMachine vm) {
        if (vm.canAddMethod()) {
            // Do something here
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine;

public class MyClass {
    
    private static final boolean JVM_TI_BASED_JDWP_BACK_END = false;

    public void myMethod(VirtualMachine vm) {
        if (JVM_TI_BASED_JDWP_BACK_END) {
            // The back-end will never set this capability to true, so skip it
            // Do something else here
        } else {
            // Do something here
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactored version, we create a constant `JVM_TI_BASED_JDWP_BACK_END` that is set to `false` to indicate that the back-end will never set the `canAddMethod()` capability to `true`. We then use this constant to conditionally execute code depending on whether the back-end is based on JVM TI or not.

Note that this refactoring assumes that you don't have access to a back-end that sets the `canAddMethod()` capability to `true`. If you do have access to such a back-end, you'll need to adjust the value of `JVM_TI_BASED_JDWP_BACK_END` accordingly.
