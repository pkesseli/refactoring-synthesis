The method java.lang.Runtime.Version.minor() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JavaÂ SE 10, the second element of a version
 number is not the minor-release number but the interim-release
 counter, incremented for every interim release.  Use the Runtime.Version.interim() method in preference to this method.  For compatibility,
 this method returns the value of the interim
 element, or zero if it is absent."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.minor()`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
