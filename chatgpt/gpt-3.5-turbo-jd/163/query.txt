The method java.net.MulticastSocket.getTTL() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "use the getTimeToLive method instead, which returns
 an int instead of a byte."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.getTTL()`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
