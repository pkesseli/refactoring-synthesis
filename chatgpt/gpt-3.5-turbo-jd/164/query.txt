The method java.net.MulticastSocket.joinGroup​(InetAddress) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not accept the network interface on
             which to join the multicast group. Use
             MulticastSocket.joinGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface) instead."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.joinGroup​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
