The method java.net.MulticastSocket.leaveGroup​(InetAddress) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not accept the network interface on which
             to leave the multicast group. Use
             MulticastSocket.leaveGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface) instead."

```
<code before refactoring here>

```
<code after refactoring here>

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
