The method java.net.MulticastSocket.setLoopbackMode​(boolean) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use DatagramSocket.setOption(SocketOption, Object) with
             StandardSocketOptions.IP_MULTICAST_LOOP
             instead. The loopback mode is enabled by default,
             MulticastSocket.setOption(StandardSocketOptions.IP_MULTICAST_LOOP, false)
             disables it."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.setLoopbackMode​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
