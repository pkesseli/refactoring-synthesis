The method java.rmi.registry.RegistryHandler.registryImpl​(int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "no replacement.  As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, RMI no
 longer uses the RegistryHandler to obtain the registry's
 implementation."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.registryImpl​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
