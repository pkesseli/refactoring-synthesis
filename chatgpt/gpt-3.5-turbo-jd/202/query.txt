The method java.rmi.server.RemoteStub.setRef​(RemoteStub, RemoteRef) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "No replacement.  The setRef method
 was intended for setting the remote reference of a remote
 stub. This is unnecessary, since RemoteStubs can be created
 and initialized with a remote reference through use of
 the RemoteStub(RemoteRef) constructor."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.setRef​(a, b)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
