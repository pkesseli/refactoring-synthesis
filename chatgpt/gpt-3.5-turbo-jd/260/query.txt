The method java.util.Date.UTC​(int, int, int, int, int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by Calendar.set(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec)
 or GregorianCalendar(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec), using a UTC
 TimeZone, followed by Calendar.getTime().getTime()."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.UTC​(a, b, c, d, e, f)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
