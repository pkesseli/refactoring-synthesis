The method java.util.logging.LogManager.getLoggingMXBean() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "java.util.logging.LoggingMXBean is deprecated and
      replaced with java.lang.management.PlatformLoggingMXBean. Use
      ManagementFactory.getPlatformMXBean(PlatformLoggingMXBean.class)
      instead."
