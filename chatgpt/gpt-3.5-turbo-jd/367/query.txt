The method javax.swing.text.TableView.createTableCell​(Element) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Table cells can now be any arbitrary
 View implementation and should be produced by the
 ViewFactory rather than the table."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.createTableCell​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
