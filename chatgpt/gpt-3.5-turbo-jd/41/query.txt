The method java.awt.Component.reshape​(int, int, int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by setBounds(int, int, int, int)."

```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
