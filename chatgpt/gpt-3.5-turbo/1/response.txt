I'm sorry, but as a language model, I cannot provide a refactoring example for the given code block without additional context. Refactoring involves modifying code to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability while preserving its functionality. Without knowing the purpose and context of the code block, it is difficult to suggest a meaningful refactoring example. Could you please provide more information or context about the code block?
