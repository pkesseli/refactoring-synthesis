Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.awt.Scrollbar.getVisible()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Scrollbar scrollbar = new Scrollbar();
int visible = scrollbar.getVisible();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Scrollbar scrollbar = new Scrollbar();
int visibleAmount = scrollbar.getVisibleAmount();
``` 

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `getVisible()` method with the recommended `getVisibleAmount()` method. This should ensure that our code remains compatible with future versions of Java.
