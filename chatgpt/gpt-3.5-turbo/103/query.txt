The method java.awt.Scrollbar.setPageIncrement​(int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by setBlockIncrement()."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
