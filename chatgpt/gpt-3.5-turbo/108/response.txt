Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method.

The deprecation warning suggests using the `getMinimumSize(int, int)` method instead of `minimumSize(int, int)`. Therefore, you can refactor your code as follows:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
TextArea textArea = new TextArea();
Dimension minimumSize = textArea.minimumSize(100, 100);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
TextArea textArea = new TextArea();
Dimension minimumSize = textArea.getMinimumSize(100, 100);
```

By using the `getMinimumSize(int, int)` method, you can avoid using the deprecated method and ensure that your code is compatible with the latest version of Java.
