Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method java.awt.Choice.countItems():

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Choice myChoice = new Choice();
int itemCount = myChoice.countItems();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Choice myChoice = new Choice();
int itemCount = myChoice.getItemCount();
```
