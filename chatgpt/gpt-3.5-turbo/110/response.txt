I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.TextArea.preferredSize(int, int)` to the recommended method `getPreferredSize(int, int)`.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
TextArea textArea = new TextArea();
Dimension preferredSize = textArea.preferredSize(500, 500);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
TextArea textArea = new TextArea();
Dimension preferredSize = textArea.getPreferredSize(500, 500);
``` 

In this example, we simply replace the deprecated method `preferredSize(int, int)` with the recommended method `getPreferredSize(int, int)`. This will ensure that our code is up-to-date with the latest Java standards and will continue to work as expected in future versions of Java.
