Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.awt.TextField.setEchoCharacter(char)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
TextField textField = new TextField();
textField.setEchoCharacter('*');
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
TextField textField = new TextField();
textField.setEchoChar('*');
```

In the refactored code, we've simply replaced the deprecated method `setEchoCharacter` with the recommended method `setEchoChar`. This will ensure that our code remains up-to-date with the latest Java standards and best practices.
