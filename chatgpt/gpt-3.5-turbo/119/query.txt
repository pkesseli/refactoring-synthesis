The method java.awt.Toolkit.getMenuShortcutKeyMask() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "It is recommended that extended modifier keys and
             Toolkit.getMenuShortcutKeyMaskEx() be used instead"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
