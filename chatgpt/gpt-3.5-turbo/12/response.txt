I'm sorry, but as a language model, I cannot provide code refactoring examples without a specific codebase to work with. However, I can provide general advice on how to refactor code that uses deprecated methods:

1. Identify the deprecated method and its deprecation comment in the Javadoc.
2. Determine the reason for the deprecation and find an alternative method or approach to achieve the same functionality.
3. Modify the code to use the alternative method or approach.
4. Remove the deprecated method and its related code.
5. Test the refactored code to ensure that it still works as expected.

Here's an example of how this process might look for the deprecated ICC_Profile.finalize() method:

<<< Before refactoring:
public class MyColorClass {
    private ICC_Profile profile;

    public MyColorClass() {
        profile = ICC_Profile.getInstance(ColorSpace.CS_sRGB);
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        profile = null;
        super.finalize();
    }
}

>>> After refactoring:
public class MyColorClass {
    private ICC_Profile profile;

    public MyColorClass() {
        profile = ICC_Profile.getInstance(ColorSpace.CS_sRGB);
    }

    public void cleanup() {
        profile = null;
    }
}

Note that in this example, the finalize() method has been replaced with a cleanup() method that explicitly sets the profile variable to null. This ensures that the object is properly cleaned up when it is no longer needed, without relying on the finalize() method.
