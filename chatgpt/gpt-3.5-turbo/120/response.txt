I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Window.applyResourceBundle(String)` to the recommended method `Component.applyComponentOrientation()`.

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Window;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public MyWindow() {
        applyResourceBundle("myResourceBundle");
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Window;
import java.awt.ComponentOrientation;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public MyWindow() {
        applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(getLocale()));
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated method `applyResourceBundle()` with the recommended method `applyComponentOrientation()`. We have also used the `ComponentOrientation.getOrientation()` method to get the appropriate orientation for the window based on the locale.
