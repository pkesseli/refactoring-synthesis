The method java.awt.Window.applyResourceBundleâ€‹(ResourceBundle) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of J2SE 1.4, replaced by
 Component.applyComponentOrientation."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
