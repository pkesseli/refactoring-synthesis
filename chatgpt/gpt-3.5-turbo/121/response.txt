I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor your code based on the deprecation warning you mentioned.

The deprecation warning suggests that you should replace the use of `java.awt.Window.applyResourceBundleâ€‹(ResourceBundle)` with `Component.applyComponentOrientation`. This means that you should modify your code to use the new method instead of the deprecated one.

Here's an example of how you could refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Window;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public MyWindow(ResourceBundle bundle) {
        applyResourceBundle(bundle);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Window;
import java.awt.ComponentOrientation;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public MyWindow(ResourceBundle bundle) {
        applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(bundle.getLocale()));
    }
}
```

In this example, we've replaced the use of `applyResourceBundle` with `applyComponentOrientation`. We've also added a call to `ComponentOrientation.getOrientation` to get the appropriate orientation for the window based on the locale of the resource bundle.
