Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Window;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public void hideWindow() {
        hide();
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Window;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public void hideWindow() {
        setVisible(false);
    }
}
```

In the original code, the `hide()` method is called to hide the window, but this method is deprecated. The refactored code replaces the call to `hide()` with a call to `setVisible(false)`, which is the recommended way to hide a window in newer versions of Java.
