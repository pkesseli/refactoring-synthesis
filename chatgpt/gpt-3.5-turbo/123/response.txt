Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Window window = new Window();
Event event = new Event(window, Event.MOUSE_DOWN, 0, 0);
window.postEvent(event);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Window window = new Window();
Event event = new Event(window, Event.MOUSE_DOWN, 0, 0);
window.dispatchEvent(event);
```
