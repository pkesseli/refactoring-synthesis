Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated `java.awt.Window.reshape(int, int, int, int)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Window window = new Window(null);
window.reshape(100, 100, 500, 500);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Window window = new Window(null);
window.setBounds(100, 100, 500, 500);
``` 

This refactoring replaces the deprecated `reshape` method with the recommended `setBounds` method, which achieves the same result of setting the size and position of the window.
