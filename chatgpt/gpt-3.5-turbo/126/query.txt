The method java.beans.Beans.instantiate​(ClassLoader, String, BeanContext, AppletInitializer) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "It is recommended to use
 Beans.instantiate(ClassLoader, String, BeanContext),
 because the Applet API is deprecated. See the
  java.applet package
 documentation for further information."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
