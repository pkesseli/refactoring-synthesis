Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
String beanName = "com.example.MyBean";
BeanContext beanContext = new BeanContextSupport();
AppletInitializer appletInitializer = null;
Object bean = Beans.instantiate(classLoader, beanName, beanContext, appletInitializer);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
String beanName = "com.example.MyBean";
BeanContext beanContext = new BeanContextSupport();
Object bean = Beans.instantiate(classLoader, beanName, beanContext);
```

In the refactored code, we removed the `AppletInitializer` parameter from the `Beans.instantiate()` method call, as it is no longer recommended to use the Applet API. Instead, we use the `Beans.instantiate(ClassLoader, String, BeanContext)` method, which is the recommended replacement.
