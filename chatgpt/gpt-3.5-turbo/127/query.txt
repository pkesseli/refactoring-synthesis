The method java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream.toString​(int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not properly convert bytes into characters.
 As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the
 ByteArrayOutputStream.toString(String charsetName) or ByteArrayOutputStream.toString(Charset charset)
 method, which takes an encoding-name or charset argument,
 or the toString() method, which uses the platform's default
 character encoding."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
