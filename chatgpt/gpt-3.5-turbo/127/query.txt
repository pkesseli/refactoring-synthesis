The method java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream.toString​(int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not properly convert bytes into characters.
 As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the
 ByteArrayOutputStream.toString(String charsetName) or ByteArrayOutputStream.toString(Charset charset)
 method, which takes an encoding-name or charset argument,
 or the toString() method, which uses the platform's default
 character encoding."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
