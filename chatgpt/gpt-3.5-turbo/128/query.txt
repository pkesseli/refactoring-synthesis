The method java.io.DataInputStream.readLine() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not properly convert bytes to characters.
 As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to read lines of text is via the
 BufferedReader.readLine() method.  Programs that use the
 DataInputStream class to read lines can be converted to use
 the BufferedReader class by replacing code of the form:
      DataInputStream d = new DataInputStream(in);
 
 with:
      BufferedReader d
          = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));
 "
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
