The method java.io.File.toURL() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not automatically escape characters that
 are illegal in URLs.  It is recommended that new code convert an
 abstract pathname into a URL by first converting it into a URI, via the
 toURI method, and then converting the URI into a URL
 via the URI.toURL method."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
