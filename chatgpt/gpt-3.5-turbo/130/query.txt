The method java.io.ObjectInputStream.readLine() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not properly convert bytes to characters.
          see DataInputStream for the details and alternatives."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
