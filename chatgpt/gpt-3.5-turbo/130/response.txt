Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
try {
    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream);
    String line = ois.readLine();
    // do something with line
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle exception
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
try {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
    String line = reader.readLine();
    // do something with line
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle exception
}
```

In the refactored code, we replace the use of `ObjectInputStream.readLine()` with `BufferedReader.readLine()`. This avoids the deprecated method and properly converts bytes to characters. We also wrap the `InputStreamReader` in a `BufferedReader` for efficiency.
