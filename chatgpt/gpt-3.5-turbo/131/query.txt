The method java.io.ObjectOutputStream.PutField.writeâ€‹(ObjectOutput) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not write the values contained by this
         PutField object in a proper format, and may
         result in corruption of the serialization stream.  The
         correct way to write PutField data is by
         calling the ObjectOutputStream.writeFields()
         method."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
