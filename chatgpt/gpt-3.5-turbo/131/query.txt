The method java.io.ObjectOutputStream.PutField.write​(ObjectOutput) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not write the values contained by this
         PutField object in a proper format, and may
         result in corruption of the serialization stream.  The
         correct way to write PutField data is by
         calling the ObjectOutputStream.writeFields()
         method."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.write​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
