I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or know what programming language you are using. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor your code based on the deprecation warning you mentioned.

The deprecation warning suggests that you should use the ObjectOutputStream.writeFields() method instead of the ObjectOutputStream.PutField.write(ObjectOutput) method. Here's an example of how you can refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("data.ser"));
PutField fields = out.putFields();
fields.put("name", "John");
fields.put("age", 30);
fields.write(out);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("data.ser"));
out.writeFields();
out.writeObject(new Person("John", 30));
```

In the refactored code, we first create an ObjectOutputStream and call the writeFields() method to write the fields contained in the PutField object. Then, we write the object to the stream using the writeObject() method. This ensures that the serialization stream is written in the correct format and avoids any potential corruption.
