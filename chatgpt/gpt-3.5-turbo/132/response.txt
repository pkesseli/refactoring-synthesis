Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
char c = 'a';
if (Character.isJavaLetter(c)) {
    System.out.println(c + " is a Java letter.");
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
char c = 'a';
if (Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(c)) {
    System.out.println(c + " is a Java identifier start.");
}
``` 

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `isJavaLetter` method with the recommended `isJavaIdentifierStart` method. This change ensures that our code is up-to-date with the latest Java API and will continue to work as expected in future versions of Java.
