The method java.lang.Character.isJavaLetterOrDigitâ€‹(char) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Replaced by isJavaIdentifierPart(char)."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
