Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
char c = ' ';
if (Character.isSpace(c)) {
    System.out.println("This is a space character.");
}
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
char c = ' ';
if (Character.isWhitespace(c)) {
    System.out.println("This is a whitespace character.");
}
``` 

In the above example, we have replaced the deprecated `isSpace` method with the recommended `isWhitespace` method. This change ensures that our code is up-to-date with the latest Java API and will continue to work as expected in future versions of Java.
