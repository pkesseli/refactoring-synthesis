The method java.lang.Class.newInstance() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method propagates any exception thrown by the
 nullary constructor, including a checked exception.  Use of
 this method effectively bypasses the compile-time exception
 checking that would otherwise be performed by the compiler.
 The Constructor.newInstance method avoids this problem by wrapping
 any exception thrown by the constructor in a (checked) InvocationTargetException.

 The call

 
 clazz.newInstance()
 

 can be replaced by

 
 clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()
 

 The latter sequence of calls is inferred to be able to throw
 the additional exception types InvocationTargetException and NoSuchMethodException. Both of these exception types are
 subclasses of ReflectiveOperationException."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
