Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to any existing code to refactor. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor the deprecated method java.lang.Class.newInstance():

<<< Before refactoring: 
MyClass obj = MyClass.class.newInstance();
>>>
After refactoring: 
MyClass obj = MyClass.class.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
