The method java.lang.ClassLoader.getPackageâ€‹(String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "If multiple class loaders delegate to each other and define classes
 with the same package name, and one such loader relies on the lookup
 behavior of getPackage to return a Package from
 a parent loader, then the properties exposed by the Package
 may not be as expected in the rest of the program.
 For example, the Package will only expose annotations from the
 package-info.class file defined by the parent loader, even if
 annotations exist in a package-info.class file defined by
 a child loader.  A more robust approach is to use the
 ClassLoader.getDefinedPackage(java.lang.String) method which returns
 a Package for the specified class loader."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
