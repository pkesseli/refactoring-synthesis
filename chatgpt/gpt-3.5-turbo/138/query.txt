The method java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.hasPrivateAccess() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method was originally designed to test PRIVATE access
 that implies full privilege access but MODULE access has since become
 independent of PRIVATE access.  It is recommended to call
 MethodHandles.Lookup.hasFullPrivilegeAccess() instead."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
