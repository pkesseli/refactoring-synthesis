I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method using the recommended method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
boolean hasPrivateAccess = lookup.hasPrivateAccess();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
boolean hasFullPrivilegeAccess = lookup.hasFullPrivilegeAccess();
```

In this example, we replaced the deprecated `lookup.hasPrivateAccess()` method with the recommended `lookup.hasFullPrivilegeAccess()` method. This change ensures that the codebase is up-to-date with the latest best practices and avoids any potential issues that may arise from using deprecated methods.
