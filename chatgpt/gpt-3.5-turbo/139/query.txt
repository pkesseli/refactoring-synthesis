The method java.lang.Object.finalize() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The finalization mechanism is inherently problematic.
 Finalization can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs.
 Errors in finalizers can lead to resource leaks; there is no way to cancel
 finalization if it is no longer necessary; and no ordering is specified
 among calls to finalize methods of different objects.
 Furthermore, there are no guarantees regarding the timing of finalization.
 The finalize method might be called on a finalizable object
 only after an indefinite delay, if at all.

 Classes whose instances hold non-heap resources should provide a method
 to enable explicit release of those resources, and they should also
 implement AutoCloseable if appropriate.
 The Cleaner and PhantomReference
 provide more flexible and efficient ways to release resources when an object
 becomes unreachable."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
