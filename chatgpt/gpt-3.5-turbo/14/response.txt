Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated `java.awt.Component.bounds()` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Component myComponent = new Component();
Rectangle bounds = myComponent.bounds();
int x = bounds.x;
int y = bounds.y;
int width = bounds.width;
int height = bounds.height;
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Component myComponent = new Component();
Rectangle bounds = myComponent.getBounds();
int x = bounds.x;
int y = bounds.y;
int width = bounds.width;
int height = bounds.height;
```

In the refactored code, we've simply replaced the deprecated `bounds()` method with the recommended `getBounds()` method. This should ensure that the code continues to work as expected, while also avoiding any potential issues that might arise from using a deprecated method.
