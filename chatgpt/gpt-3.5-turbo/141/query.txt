The method java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject.isAccessible() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is deprecated because its name hints that it checks
 if the reflected object is accessible when it actually indicates
 if the checks for Java language access control are suppressed.
 This method may return false on a reflected object that is
 accessible to the caller. To test if this reflected object is accessible,
 it should use AccessibleObject.canAccess(Object)."
