The method java.lang.reflect.Proxy.getProxyClassâ€‹(ClassLoader, Class&lt;?&gt;...) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Proxy classes generated in a named module are encapsulated
      and not accessible to code outside its module.
      Constructor.newInstance
      will throw IllegalAccessException when it is called on
      an inaccessible proxy class.
      Use Proxy.newProxyInstance(ClassLoader, Class[], InvocationHandler)
      to create a proxy instance instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
