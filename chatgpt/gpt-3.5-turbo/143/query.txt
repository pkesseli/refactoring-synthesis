The method java.lang.Runtime.Version.major() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JavaÂ SE 10, the first element of a version
 number is not the major-release number but the feature-release
 counter, incremented for every time-based release.  Use the Runtime.Version.feature() method in preference to this method.  For compatibility,
 this method returns the value of the feature
 element."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
