The method java.lang.Runtime.Version.security() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JavaÂ SE 10, the third element of a version
 number is not the security level but the update-release counter,
 incremented for every update release.  Use the Runtime.Version.update()
 method in preference to this method.  For compatibility, this method
 returns the value of the update element, or
 zero if it is absent."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.security()`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
