The method java.lang.String.getBytes​(int, int, byte[], int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not properly convert characters into
 bytes.  As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the
 String.getBytes() method, which uses the platform's default charset."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
