The method java.lang.String.getBytes​(int, int, byte[], int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not properly convert characters into
 bytes.  As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the
 String.getBytes() method, which uses the platform's default charset."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
