The method java.lang.Thread.countStackFrames() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method was originally designed to count the number of
             stack frames but the results were never well-defined and it
             depended on thread-suspension.
             This method is subject to removal in a future version of Java SE."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
