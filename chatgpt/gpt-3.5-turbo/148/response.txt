I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or know what programming language you are using. However, I can give you a general example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `java.lang.Thread.countStackFrames()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Thread.currentThread().countStackFrames();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
StackTraceElement[] stackTrace = Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();
int stackDepth = stackTrace.length;
```

This refactored code uses the `getStackTrace()` method to retrieve the current thread's stack trace as an array of `StackTraceElement` objects. The length of this array is then used to determine the number of stack frames. This approach is more reliable than using `countStackFrames()` because it does not depend on thread suspension and provides a consistent result.
