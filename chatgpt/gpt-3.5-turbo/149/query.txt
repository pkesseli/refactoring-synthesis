The method java.lang.Thread.resume() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method exists solely for use with Thread.suspend(),
     which has been deprecated because it is deadlock-prone.
     For more information, see
     Why
     are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
