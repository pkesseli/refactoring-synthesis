Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.suspend();
// do some work
thread.resume();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.start();
// do some work
thread.interrupt();
```

In the original code, `Thread.suspend()` and `Thread.resume()` are used to pause and resume the execution of a thread. However, these methods are deprecated because they can cause deadlocks. Instead, we can use `Thread.start()` to start the thread and `Thread.interrupt()` to interrupt it when we want to pause its execution. This is a safer and more reliable way to control the execution of a thread.
