Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Component myComponent = new Component();
Event myEvent = new Event(myComponent, 0, 1);
myComponent.deliverEvent(myEvent);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Component myComponent = new Component();
Event myEvent = new Event(myComponent, 0, 1);
myComponent.dispatchEvent(myEvent);
```
