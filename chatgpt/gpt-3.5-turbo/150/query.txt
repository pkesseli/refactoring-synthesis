The method java.lang.Thread.stop() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is inherently unsafe.  Stopping a thread with
       Thread.stop causes it to unlock all of the monitors that it
       has locked (as a natural consequence of the unchecked
       ThreadDeath exception propagating up the stack).  If
       any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in
       an inconsistent state, the damaged objects become visible to
       other threads, potentially resulting in arbitrary behavior.  Many
       uses of stop should be replaced by code that simply
       modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should
       stop running.  The target thread should check this variable
       regularly, and return from its run method in an orderly fashion
       if the variable indicates that it is to stop running.  If the
       target thread waits for long periods (on a condition variable,
       for example), the interrupt method should be used to
       interrupt the wait.

       Why
       are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
