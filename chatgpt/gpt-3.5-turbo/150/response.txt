Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Thread myThread = new Thread(() -> {
    while (true) {
        // do some work
    }
});

myThread.start();

// stop the thread after 5 seconds
try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
    myThread.stop(); // deprecated method
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
volatile boolean stopThread = false;

Thread myThread = new Thread(() -> {
    while (!stopThread) {
        // do some work
    }
});

myThread.start();

// stop the thread after 5 seconds
try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
    stopThread = true;
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `Thread.stop()` method with a boolean flag `stopThread`. The thread's `while` loop now checks this flag to determine whether to continue running or not. When we want to stop the thread, we simply set the flag to `true`. This allows the thread to exit its `while` loop and terminate gracefully.
