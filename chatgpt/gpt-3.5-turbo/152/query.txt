The method java.lang.ThreadGroup.allowThreadSuspensionâ€‹(boolean) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The definition of this call depends on ThreadGroup.suspend(),
             which is deprecated.  Further, the behavior of this call
             was never specified."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
