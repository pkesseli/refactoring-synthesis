Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myGroup");
group.allowThreadSuspension(true);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myGroup");
group.setDaemon(true);
``` 

Explanation: Instead of using the deprecated `allowThreadSuspension` method, we can use the `setDaemon` method to achieve a similar effect. Setting a thread group as a daemon group means that any threads created within that group will automatically be marked as daemon threads, which can be suspended by the JVM if necessary. This achieves the same effect as calling `allowThreadSuspension(true)`.
