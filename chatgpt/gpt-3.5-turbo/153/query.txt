The method java.lang.ThreadGroup.resume() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is used solely in conjunction with
       Thread.suspend and ThreadGroup.suspend,
       both of which have been deprecated, as they are inherently
       deadlock-prone.  See Thread.suspend() for details."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.resume()`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
