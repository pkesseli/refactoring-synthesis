The method java.lang.ThreadGroup.stop() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is inherently unsafe.  See
     Thread.stop() for details."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
