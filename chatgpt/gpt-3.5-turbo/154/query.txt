The method java.lang.ThreadGroup.stop() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is inherently unsafe.  See
     Thread.stop() for details."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
