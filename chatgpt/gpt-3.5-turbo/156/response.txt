Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
BigDecimal result = dividend.divide(divisor, 2);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
BigDecimal result = dividend.divide(divisor, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
``` 

In this example, we've replaced the deprecated `BigDecimal.divide(BigDecimal, int)` method with the recommended `BigDecimal.divide(BigDecimal, RoundingMode)` method. We've also specified the rounding mode to be `RoundingMode.HALF_UP`, which is a common rounding mode used in financial calculations.
