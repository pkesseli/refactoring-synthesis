The method java.math.BigDecimal.setScale​(int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The method BigDecimal.setScale(int, RoundingMode) should
 be used in preference to this legacy method."

```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
