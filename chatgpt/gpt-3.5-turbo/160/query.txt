The method java.net.DatagramSocketImpl.setTTLâ€‹(byte) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "use setTimeToLive instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
