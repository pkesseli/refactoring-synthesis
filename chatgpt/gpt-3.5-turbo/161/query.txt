The method java.net.MulticastSocket.getInterface() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The network interface may not be uniquely identified by
             the InetAddress returned.
             Use MulticastSocket.getNetworkInterface() instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
