The method java.net.MulticastSocket.getInterface() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The network interface may not be uniquely identified by
             the InetAddress returned.
             Use MulticastSocket.getNetworkInterface() instead."

```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
