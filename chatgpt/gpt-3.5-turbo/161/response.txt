Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(port);
socket.setInterface(address);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(port);
NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(address);
socket.setNetworkInterface(networkInterface);
```
