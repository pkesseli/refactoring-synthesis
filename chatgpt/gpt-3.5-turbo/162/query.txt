The method java.net.MulticastSocket.getLoopbackMode() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use DatagramSocket.getOption(SocketOption) with
             StandardSocketOptions.IP_MULTICAST_LOOP
             instead."

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
