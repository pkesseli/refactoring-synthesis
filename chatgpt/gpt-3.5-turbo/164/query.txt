The method java.net.MulticastSocket.joinGroupâ€‹(InetAddress) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not accept the network interface on
             which to join the multicast group. Use
             MulticastSocket.joinGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface) instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
