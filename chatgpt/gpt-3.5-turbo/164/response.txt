Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(1234);
socket.joinGroup(group);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
SocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress(group, 1234);
NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByName("eth0");
socket.joinGroup(address, networkInterface);
```

In the refactored code, we create a `MulticastSocket` without specifying a port number, and instead create a `SocketAddress` object with the group address and port number. We also specify the network interface to use with the `joinGroup` method. This is the recommended way to join a multicast group in Java, as the `joinGroup` method that takes an `InetAddress` is now deprecated.
