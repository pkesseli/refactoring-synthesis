The method java.net.MulticastSocket.setInterfaceâ€‹(InetAddress) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The InetAddress may not uniquely identify
             the network interface. Use
             MulticastSocket.setNetworkInterface(NetworkInterface) instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
