Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(1234);
socket.setInterface(group);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(1234);
NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(group);
socket.setNetworkInterface(networkInterface);
```
