The method java.net.URLConnection.getDefaultRequestPropertyâ€‹(String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The instance specific getRequestProperty method
 should be used after an appropriate instance of URLConnection
 is obtained."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
