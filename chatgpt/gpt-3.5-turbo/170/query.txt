The method java.net.URLConnection.getDefaultRequestProperty​(String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The instance specific getRequestProperty method
 should be used after an appropriate instance of URLConnection
 is obtained."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.getDefaultRequestProperty​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
