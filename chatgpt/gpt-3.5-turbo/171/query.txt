The method java.net.URLConnection.setDefaultRequestProperty​(String, String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The instance specific setRequestProperty method
 should be used after an appropriate instance of URLConnection
 is obtained. Invoking this method will have no effect."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.setDefaultRequestProperty​(a, b)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
