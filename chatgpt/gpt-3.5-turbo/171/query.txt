The method java.net.URLConnection.setDefaultRequestPropertyâ€‹(String, String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The instance specific setRequestProperty method
 should be used after an appropriate instance of URLConnection
 is obtained. Invoking this method will have no effect."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
