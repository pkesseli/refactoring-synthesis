Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
URLConnection connection = new URL("https://example.com").openConnection();
connection.setDefaultRequestProperty("Authorization", "Bearer myToken");
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
URL url = new URL("https://example.com");
URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
connection.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Bearer myToken");
``` 

In the refactored code, we first create a `URL` object and then call `openConnection()` to obtain an instance of `URLConnection`. We then use the `setRequestProperty()` method on the `URLConnection` instance to set the `Authorization` header. This is the recommended approach according to the deprecation comment in the Javadoc.
