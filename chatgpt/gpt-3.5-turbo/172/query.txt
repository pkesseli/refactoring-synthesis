The method java.net.URLDecoder.decode​(String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The resulting string may vary depending on the platform's
          default encoding. Instead, use the decode(String,String) method
          to specify the encoding."

```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
