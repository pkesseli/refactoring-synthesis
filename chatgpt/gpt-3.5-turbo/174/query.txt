The method java.net.URLStreamHandler.setURL​(URL, String, String, int, String, String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use setURL(URL, String, String, int, String, String, String,
             String);"
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.setURL​(a, b, c, d, e, f)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
