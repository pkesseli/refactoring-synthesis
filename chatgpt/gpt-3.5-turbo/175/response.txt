Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method java.rmi.dgc.VMID.isUnique():

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.rmi.dgc.VMID;

public class MyObject {
    private VMID id;

    public MyObject() {
        id = new VMID();
    }

    public boolean isIdUnique() {
        return id.isUnique();
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.rmi.dgc.VMID;
import java.util.UUID;

public class MyObject {
    private UUID id;

    public MyObject() {
        id = UUID.randomUUID();
    }

    public boolean isIdUnique() {
        // UUIDs are always unique, so this method always returns true
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the use of the deprecated VMID.isUnique() method with the use of the UUID.randomUUID() method, which generates a unique identifier. We've also changed the type of the id field from VMID to UUID. The isIdUnique() method now always returns true, since UUIDs are always unique.
