I'm happy to help! However, I must clarify that as an AI language model, I cannot refactor code. However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method.

When a method is deprecated, it means that it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions of the software. In this case, the deprecation comment states that there is no replacement for the method.

To refactor the code, you will need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality without using the deprecated method. One approach could be to use a different method or class that provides similar functionality.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
SecurityContext securityContext = LoaderHandler.getSecurityContext(classLoader);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
// Use a different method or class to obtain the security context
SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
if (securityManager != null) {
    securityContext = securityManager.getSecurityContext();
} else {
    // Handle the case where there is no security manager
}
``` 

In this example, we have replaced the deprecated `LoaderHandler.getSecurityContext` method with the `SecurityManager.getSecurityContext` method. We first check if a security manager is installed, and if so, we obtain the security context from it. If there is no security manager, we handle the case appropriately.
