Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
try {
    Class<?> clazz = LoaderHandler.loadClass(className);
    // use the loaded class...
} catch (Exception e) {
    // handle the exception...
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
try {
    Class<?> clazz = Class.forName(className);
    // use the loaded class...
} catch (Exception e) {
    // handle the exception...
}
```

In the refactored code, we replace the deprecated `LoaderHandler.loadClass` method with the `Class.forName` method, which is the recommended replacement according to the Javadoc. This should ensure that the code continues to work as expected while avoiding the use of a deprecated method.
