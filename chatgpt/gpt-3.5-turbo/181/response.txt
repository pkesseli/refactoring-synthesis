Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.LogStream.getDefaultStream()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        LogStream logStream = LogStream.getDefaultStream();
        logStream.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyClass {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());

    public void myMethod() {
        LOGGER.info("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `LogStream.getDefaultStream()` method with the `java.util.logging.Logger` class, which is the recommended logging framework for Java. We've created a private static final `LOGGER` field in our class, and used the `LOGGER.info()` method to log our message instead of `LogStream.println()`. This code should work just as well as the original code, but without using a deprecated method.
