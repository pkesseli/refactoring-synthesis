Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        LogStream logStream = LogStream.log("myLog");
        String logString = logStream.toString();
        System.out.println(logString);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        LogStream logStream = LogStream.log("myLog");
        String logString = logStream.getLog();
        System.out.println(logString);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we replace the deprecated `toString()` method with the `getLog()` method, which returns the log message as a string. This allows us to continue using the `LogStream` class without relying on a deprecated method.
