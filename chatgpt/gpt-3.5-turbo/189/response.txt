Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(int)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
try {
    LogStream logStream = LogStream.log("myLogFile");
    logStream.write(1);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
try {
    FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("myLogFile", true);
    fileOutputStream.write(1);
    fileOutputStream.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `LogStream.write(int)` method with `FileOutputStream.write(int)`. We've also added the `true` parameter to the `FileOutputStream` constructor to indicate that we want to append to the file rather than overwrite it. Finally, we've manually closed the `FileOutputStream` to ensure that any buffered data is written to the file before the program exits.
