Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public void gotFocus(Event evt, Object obj) {
    // do something when component gains focus
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent evt) {
    if (evt.getID() == FocusEvent.FOCUS_GAINED) {
        // do something when component gains focus
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `gotFocus` method with the recommended `processFocusEvent` method. We've also added a check to make sure we're only handling the `FOCUS_GAINED` event, since that's the equivalent of the old `gotFocus` method.
