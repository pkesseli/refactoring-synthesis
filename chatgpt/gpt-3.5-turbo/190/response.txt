Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.Operation.getOperation()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Operation op = ...;
int operation = op.getOperation();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Operation op = ...;
int operation = op.hashCode();
```

Note: This is just an example and may not be suitable for all use cases. It's important to carefully consider the implications of any refactoring before making changes to your code.
