Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Operation op = ...;
String opString = op.toString();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Operation op = ...;
String opString = "Operation: " + op.getClass().getName();
``` 

In this refactored code, we're no longer using the deprecated `toString()` method. Instead, we're constructing a custom string representation of the `Operation` object by concatenating the string "Operation: " with the fully qualified class name of the object. This provides a more descriptive and informative string representation of the object, without relying on a deprecated method.
