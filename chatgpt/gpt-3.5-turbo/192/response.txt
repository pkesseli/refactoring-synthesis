Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.done()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
remoteCall.done();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
// Do something else instead of calling remoteCall.done()
``` 

Since there is no replacement for the `done()` method and the Javadoc comment states that there is no alternative, the best approach would be to simply remove the call to `done()` and replace it with some other code that achieves the same result. The specific replacement code would depend on the context in which `done()` was being called and what it was being used for.
