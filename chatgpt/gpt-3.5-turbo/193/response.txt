Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
RemoteCall call = ...;
call.executeCall();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
RemoteCall call = ...;
// Do something else instead of calling executeCall()
``` 

Since the `executeCall()` method is deprecated and there is no replacement, the best course of action is to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality. Depending on the specific use case, this could involve using a different method or approach altogether.
