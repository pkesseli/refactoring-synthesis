Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
InputStream inputStream = remoteCall.getInputStream();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
InputStream inputStream = remoteCall.getDataStream();
``` 

In this refactoring, we've replaced the deprecated `getInputStream()` method with a new method called `getDataStream()`. This new method serves the same purpose as the old one, but is not deprecated and can be used safely.
