Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
OutputStream outputStream = remoteCall.getOutputStream();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
OutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
``` 

In this refactoring, we replace the call to `remoteCall.getOutputStream()` with the creation of a new `ByteArrayOutputStream`. This is because the `getOutputStream()` method is deprecated and has no replacement, so we need to find an alternative way to write data to the remote call's output stream. By using a `ByteArrayOutputStream`, we can write data to an in-memory buffer and then send that buffer over the network using the `RemoteCall` object's other methods.
