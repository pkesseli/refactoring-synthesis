Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
RemoteCall call = ...;
InputStream resultStream = call.getResultStream(true);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
RemoteCall call = ...;
Object result = call.getResult();
if (result instanceof InputStream) {
    InputStream resultStream = (InputStream) result;
    // use resultStream as needed
} else {
    // handle error case
}
```
