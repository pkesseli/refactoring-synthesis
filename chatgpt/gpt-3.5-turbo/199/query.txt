The method java.rmi.server.RemoteRef.done​(RemoteCall) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "1.2 style stubs no longer use this method. Instead of
 using a sequence of method calls to the remote reference
 (newCall, invoke, and done), a
 stub uses a single method, invoke(Remote, Method, Object[],
 int), on the remote reference to carry out parameter
 marshalling, remote method executing and unmarshalling of the return
 value."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.done​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
