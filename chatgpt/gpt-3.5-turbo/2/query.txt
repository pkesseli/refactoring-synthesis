The method com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use OperatingSystemMXBean.getFreeMemorySize() instead of
 this historically named method."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
