Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public void handleEvent(Event event) {
    if (event.id == Event.MOUSE_DOWN) {
        // handle mouse down event
    } else if (event.id == Event.MOUSE_UP) {
        // handle mouse up event
    } else if (event.id == Event.KEY_PRESS) {
        // handle key press event
    } else if (event.id == Event.KEY_RELEASE) {
        // handle key release event
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public void processEvent(AWTEvent event) {
    if (event instanceof MouseEvent) {
        MouseEvent mouseEvent = (MouseEvent) event;
        if (mouseEvent.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_PRESSED) {
            // handle mouse down event
        } else if (mouseEvent.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED) {
            // handle mouse up event
        }
    } else if (event instanceof KeyEvent) {
        KeyEvent keyEvent = (KeyEvent) event;
        if (keyEvent.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED) {
            // handle key press event
        } else if (keyEvent.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED) {
            // handle key release event
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactoring, we've replaced the deprecated `handleEvent` method with the recommended `processEvent` method. We've also updated the code to use the newer `MouseEvent` and `KeyEvent` classes instead of the old `Event` class. This makes the code more modern and easier to maintain.
