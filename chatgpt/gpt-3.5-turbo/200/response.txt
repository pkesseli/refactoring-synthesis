I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or know what specific code you are working with. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method java.rmi.server.RemoteRef.invoke(RemoteCall).

Before refactoring:
```
RemoteRef ref = ...;
RemoteCall call = ref.newCall(...);
call.setMethod(...);
call.setArguments(...);
ref.invoke(call);
```

After refactoring:
```
Remote ref = ...;
Method method = ...;
Object[] args = ...;
int timeout = ...;
Object result = ref.invoke(method, args, timeout);
``` 

In the refactored code, instead of using the deprecated method, we use the `invoke` method on the remote reference to carry out parameter marshalling, remote method executing, and unmarshalling of the return value. We pass in the method to be invoked, the arguments to be passed to the method, and a timeout value. The `invoke` method returns the result of the remote method call.
