Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
RemoteRef ref = someRemoteObject.getRef();
Operation[] ops = someOperations;
int opnum = someOpNum;
long hash = someHash;
Call call = ref.newCall(someRemoteObject, ops, opnum, hash);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
RemoteRef ref = someRemoteObject.getRef();
Method method = someMethod;
Object[] args = someArgs;
int opnum = someOpNum;
Call call = ref.invoke(someRemoteObject, method, args, opnum);
``` 

Note that the specific implementation may vary depending on the context of your code.
