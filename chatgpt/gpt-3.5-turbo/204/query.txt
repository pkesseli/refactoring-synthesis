The method java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader.loadClassâ€‹(String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by loadClass(String,String) method"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
