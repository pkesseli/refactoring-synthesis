Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public class MyRemoteObject extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteInterface {
    // other methods and fields here

    public void dispatch(Remote obj, RemoteCall call, int opnum, long hash) throws IOException {
        super.dispatch(obj, call, opnum, hash);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public class MyRemoteObject extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteInterface {
    // other methods and fields here

    @Override
    public void exportObject(Remote obj) throws RemoteException {
        super.exportObject(obj);
    }
}
```

In this refactoring, we're replacing the deprecated `dispatch` method with the `exportObject` method, which is not deprecated and serves a similar purpose. We're also adding the `@Override` annotation to ensure that we're correctly overriding the method from the superclass.
