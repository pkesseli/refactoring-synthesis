The method java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject.exportObjectâ€‹(Remote) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is deprecated because it supports only static stubs.
 Use exportObject(Remote, port) or
 exportObject(Remote, port, csf, ssf)
 instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
