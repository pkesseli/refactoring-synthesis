Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Provider provider = Security.getProvider("BC");
int version = provider.getVersion();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Provider provider = Security.getProvider("BC");
String version = provider.getVersionStr();
``` 

In the refactored code, we're using the `getVersionStr()` method instead of the deprecated `getVersion()` method to retrieve the version of the `Provider` object. This change ensures that our code is up-to-date with the latest best practices and avoids any potential issues that may arise from using deprecated methods.
