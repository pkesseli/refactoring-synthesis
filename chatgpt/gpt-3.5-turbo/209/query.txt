The method java.security.Security.getAlgorithmPropertyâ€‹(String, String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method used to return the value of a proprietary
 property in the master file of the "SUN" Cryptographic Service
 Provider in order to determine how to parse algorithm-specific
 parameters. Use the new provider-based and algorithm-independent
 AlgorithmParameters and KeyFactory engine
 classes (introduced in the J2SE version 1.2 platform) instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
