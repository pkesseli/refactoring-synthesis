The method java.security.Security.getAlgorithmProperty​(String, String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method used to return the value of a proprietary
 property in the master file of the "SUN" Cryptographic Service
 Provider in order to determine how to parse algorithm-specific
 parameters. Use the new provider-based and algorithm-independent
 AlgorithmParameters and KeyFactory engine
 classes (introduced in the J2SE version 1.2 platform) instead."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.getAlgorithmProperty​(a, b)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
