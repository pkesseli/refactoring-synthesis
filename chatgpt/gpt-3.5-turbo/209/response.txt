Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide code examples in a straight-line code block format. However, I can provide you with a refactoring suggestion for the deprecated method java.security.Security.getAlgorithmPropertyâ€‹(String, String).

Before refactoring:
```
String algorithm = "AES";
String property = "IV";
String value = Security.getAlgorithmProperty(algorithm, property);
```

After refactoring:
```
String algorithm = "AES";
AlgorithmParameters params = AlgorithmParameters.getInstance(algorithm);
params.init(new IvParameterSpec(new byte[params.getBlockSize()]));
``` 

In the refactored code, we are using the AlgorithmParameters class to initialize the parameters for the specified algorithm. This is a provider-based and algorithm-independent approach, which is recommended over the deprecated method.
