Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.sql.Date.getSeconds()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
int seconds = date.getSeconds();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
int seconds = (int) (date.getTime() / 1000) % 60;
```

In the refactored code, we use the `getTime()` method to get the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT, and then divide by 1000 to get the number of seconds. We then use the modulo operator `%` to get the remainder when dividing by 60, which gives us the number of seconds within the current minute. This is equivalent to the deprecated `getSeconds()` method, but avoids using a deprecated API.
