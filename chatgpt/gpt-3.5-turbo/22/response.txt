Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated `inside` method in Java:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
if (component.inside(x, y)) {
    // do something
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
if (component.contains(x, y)) {
    // do something
}
```

This refactoring simply replaces the deprecated `inside` method with the recommended `contains` method.
