Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.io.PrintStream;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      PrintStream logStream = DriverManager.getLogStream();
      logStream.println("Logging message");
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      PrintWriter logWriter = DriverManager.getLogWriter();
      logWriter.println("Logging message");
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
``` 

In this example, we've replaced the deprecated `getLogStream()` method with the recommended `getLogWriter()` method. We've also updated the import statement to use `PrintWriter` instead of `PrintStream`, since that's the type returned by `getLogWriter()`.
