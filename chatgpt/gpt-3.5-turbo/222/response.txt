Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.io.PrintStream;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      PrintStream logStream = new PrintStream("log.txt");
      DriverManager.setLogStream(logStream);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      PrintWriter logWriter = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("log.txt"));
      DriverManager.setLogWriter(logWriter);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `setLogStream` method with the recommended `setLogWriter` method. We've also updated the code to use a `PrintWriter` instead of a `PrintStream`, since that's what `setLogWriter` expects. Finally, we've wrapped the `FileWriter` in a `PrintWriter` to make it easier to write to the log file.
