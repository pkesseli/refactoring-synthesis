Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
if (component.isFocusTraversable()) {
    component.requestFocus();
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
if (component.isFocusable()) {
    component.requestFocus();
}
``` 

In this example, we've replaced the deprecated `isFocusTraversable()` method with the recommended `isFocusable()` method. This ensures that the code will continue to work as expected in future versions of Java.
