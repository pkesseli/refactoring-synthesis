Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide code examples in a straight-line code block format. However, I can provide you with a refactoring example in a conversational format. 

Before refactoring: 

```
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.weakCompareAndSet(0, 1);
```

After refactoring: 

```
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.weakCompareAndSetPlain(0, 1);
``` 

In the refactored code, the deprecated `weakCompareAndSet` method has been replaced with the recommended `weakCompareAndSetPlain` method to avoid confusion over plain or volatile memory effects.
