Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide code examples in a straight-line code block format. However, I can provide you with a conversational explanation of how to refactor the deprecated method.

To refactor the deprecated method java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong.weakCompareAndSetâ€‹(long, long), you should replace it with the recommended method AtomicLong.weakCompareAndSetPlain(long, long). This will avoid confusion over plain or volatile memory effects.

Here's an example of how to refactor the code:

Before refactoring:
```
AtomicLong atomicLong = new AtomicLong(0);
long expectedValue = 0;
long newValue = 1;
boolean result = atomicLong.weakCompareAndSet(expectedValue, newValue);
```

After refactoring:
```
AtomicLong atomicLong = new AtomicLong(0);
long expectedValue = 0;
long newValue = 1;
boolean result = atomicLong.weakCompareAndSetPlain(expectedValue, newValue);
```

By using the recommended method, you can ensure that your code is up-to-date and avoids any confusion over memory effects.
