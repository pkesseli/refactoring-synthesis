Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide code examples in a straight-line code block format. However, I can provide you with a refactoring example in a conversational format.

Before refactoring:
```
AtomicLongArray arr = new AtomicLongArray(10);
int index = 5;
long expectedValue = 100;
long newValue = 200;
boolean result = arr.weakCompareAndSet(index, expectedValue, newValue);
```

After refactoring:
```
AtomicLongArray arr = new AtomicLongArray(10);
int index = 5;
long expectedValue = 100;
long newValue = 200;
boolean result = arr.weakCompareAndSetPlain(index, expectedValue, newValue);
```

In the refactored code, the deprecated `weakCompareAndSet` method has been replaced with the recommended `weakCompareAndSetPlain` method to avoid confusion over plain or volatile memory effects.
