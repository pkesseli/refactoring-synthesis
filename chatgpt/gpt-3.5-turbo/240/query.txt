The method java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference.weakCompareAndSetâ€‹(V, V) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has plain memory effects but the method
 name implies volatile memory effects (see methods such as
 AtomicReference.compareAndExchange(V, V) and AtomicReference.compareAndSet(V, V)).  To avoid
 confusion over plain or volatile memory effects it is recommended that
 the method AtomicReference.weakCompareAndSetPlain(V, V) be used instead."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
