Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public void keyUp(Event event, int key) {
    // do something
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public void processKeyEvent(KeyEvent event) {
    if (event.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED) {
        int key = event.getKeyCode();
        // do something
    }
}
```
