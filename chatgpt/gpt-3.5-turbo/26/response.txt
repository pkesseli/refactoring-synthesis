I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Component.layout()` to `doLayout()`.

Before refactoring:
```
public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
    public void layoutContainer(Container parent) {
        super.layout();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
    public void layoutContainer(Container parent) {
        super.doLayout();
    }
}
```

In this example, we simply replaced the deprecated `layout()` method with the recommended `doLayout()` method. This ensures that our code is up-to-date with the latest Java standards and best practices.
