Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide code examples in a straight-line code block format. However, I can provide you with a refactoring example for the deprecated method java.util.Date.UTCâ€‹(int, int, int, int, int, int) in a conversational format.

Before refactoring:
```
long timestamp = Date.UTC(year, month, day, hour, minute, second);
```

After refactoring:
```
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance(TimeZone.getTimeZone("UTC"));
calendar.set(year + 1900, month, day, hour, minute, second);
long timestamp = calendar.getTime().getTime();
```

In the refactored code, we first create a Calendar instance with the UTC timezone. Then, we set the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values using the set() method. Finally, we get the time in milliseconds using the getTime() method and assign it to the timestamp variable. This way, we avoid using the deprecated Date.UTC() method and use the recommended Calendar and TimeZone classes instead.
