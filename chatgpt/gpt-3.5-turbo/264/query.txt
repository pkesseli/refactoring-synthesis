The method java.util.logging.Logger.logrbâ€‹(Level, String, String, String, String, Throwable) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use Logger.logrb(java.util.logging.Level, java.lang.String,
     java.lang.String, java.util.ResourceBundle, java.lang.String,
     java.lang.Throwable) instead."
