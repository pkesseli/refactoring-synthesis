The method java.util.logging.LogRecord.setMillisâ€‹(long) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "LogRecord maintains timestamps with nanosecond resolution,
             using Instant values. For this reason,
             setInstant()
             should be used in preference to setMillis()."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
