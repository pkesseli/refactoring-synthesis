Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
LogRecord record = new LogRecord(Level.INFO, "Hello, world!");
record.setMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
logger.log(record);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
LogRecord record = new LogRecord(Level.INFO, "Hello, world!");
record.setInstant(Instant.now());
logger.log(record);
```

In the original code, the `setMillis` method is used to set the timestamp of the `LogRecord` to the current time in milliseconds. However, this method is deprecated in favor of `setInstant`, which sets the timestamp using an `Instant` object with nanosecond resolution. The refactored code uses `Instant.now()` to get the current time with nanosecond precision and sets it on the `LogRecord` using `setInstant`.
