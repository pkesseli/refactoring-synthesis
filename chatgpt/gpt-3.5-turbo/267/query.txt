The method java.util.Properties.save​(OutputStream, String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not throw an IOException if an I/O error
 occurs while saving the property list.  The preferred way to save a
 properties list is via the store(OutputStream out,
 String comments) method or the
 storeToXML(OutputStream os, String comment) method."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.save​(a, b)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
