Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("key1", "value1");
props.setProperty("key2", "value2");
FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("config.properties");
props.save(out, "My Config");
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("key1", "value1");
props.setProperty("key2", "value2");
try (FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("config.properties")) {
    props.store(out, "My Config");
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle the exception
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `save` method with the `store` method, which is the preferred way to save a properties list. We've also wrapped the `FileOutputStream` in a try-with-resources block to ensure that it's properly closed, and added exception handling in case an I/O error occurs while saving the properties list.
