Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated `java.awt.Component.locate(int, int)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Component myComponent = ...;
int x = ...;
int y = ...;
Point location = myComponent.getLocation();
if (x >= location.x && x < location.x + myComponent.getWidth() &&
    y >= location.y && y < location.y + myComponent.getHeight()) {
    // Do something with myComponent
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Component myComponent = ...;
int x = ...;
int y = ...;
Component componentAtPoint = myComponent.getComponentAt(x, y);
if (componentAtPoint == myComponent) {
    // Do something with myComponent
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `locate(int, int)` method with the recommended `getComponentAt(int, int)` method. We then check if the returned component is the same as the original component, which is equivalent to checking if the original component contains the given point.
