I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide code refactoring examples without a specific codebase to work with. However, I can provide you with general advice on how to refactor deprecated code:

1. Identify the deprecated code and its deprecation comment in the Javadoc.
2. Look for alternative methods or classes that can replace the deprecated code.
3. Modify the code to use the alternative methods or classes.
4. Remove the deprecated code and its related comment.
5. Test the refactored code to ensure it works as expected.

Remember to always follow the deprecation comment's advice and migrate to alternative mechanisms to avoid potential issues in the future.
