The method javax.management.AttributeValueExp.setMBeanServerâ€‹(MBeanServer) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has no effect.  The MBean Server used to
 obtain an attribute value is QueryEval.getMBeanServer()."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
