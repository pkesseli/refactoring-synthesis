The method javax.management.MBeanServer.deserializeâ€‹(String, byte[]) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use MBeanServer.getClassLoaderRepository() to obtain the
 class loader repository and use it to deserialize."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
