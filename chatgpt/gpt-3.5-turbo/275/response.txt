I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to a specific codebase to provide a refactoring example. However, I can give you some general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method.

Before refactoring:
```
MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
byte[] serializedObject = // some serialized object
Object obj = mbs.deserialize("ObjectName", serializedObject);
```

After refactoring:
```
MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
ClassLoaderRepository clr = mbs.getClassLoaderRepository();
byte[] serializedObject = // some serialized object
Object obj = clr.deserialize("ObjectName", serializedObject);
```

In the refactored code, we are using the `getClassLoaderRepository()` method to obtain the class loader repository and then using it to deserialize the serialized object. This is the recommended approach as per the deprecation comment in the Javadoc.
