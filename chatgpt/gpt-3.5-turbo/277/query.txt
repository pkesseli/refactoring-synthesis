The method javax.management.MBeanServer.deserializeâ€‹(ObjectName, byte[]) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use getClassLoaderFor to
 obtain the appropriate class loader for deserialization."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
