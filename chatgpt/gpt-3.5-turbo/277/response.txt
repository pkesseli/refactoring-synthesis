I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to a specific codebase to provide a refactoring example. However, I can give you some general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method.

Before refactoring:
```
MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
ObjectName name = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyMBean");
byte[] serializedObject = getSerializedObject();
Object obj = mbs.deserialize(name, serializedObject);
```

After refactoring:
```
MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
ObjectName name = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyMBean");
byte[] serializedObject = getSerializedObject();
ClassLoader cl = mbs.getClassLoaderFor(name);
ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(serializedObject));
Object obj = in.readObject();
in.close();
``` 

In the refactored code, we use the `getClassLoaderFor` method to obtain the appropriate class loader for deserialization. Then, we create an `ObjectInputStream` from the serialized byte array and use it to read the object. Finally, we close the input stream to release any resources it holds.
