Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
long derivedGaugeTimeStamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
ObjectName objectName = counterMonitor.getObservedObject();
long derivedGaugeTimeStamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
```
