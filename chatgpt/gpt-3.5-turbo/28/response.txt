Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void doSomething() {
        int x = location().x;
        int y = location().y;
        System.out.println("Component location: (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Point;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void doSomething() {
        Point location = getLocation();
        int x = location.x;
        int y = location.y;
        System.out.println("Component location: (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `location()` method with the recommended `getLocation()` method. We've also updated the code to use a `Point` object to store the location, which is the type returned by `getLocation()`.
