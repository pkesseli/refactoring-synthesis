I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to refactor your code based on the deprecation message you provided.

The deprecation message suggests that you should replace the usage of `javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor.getThreshold()` with `CounterMonitor.getThreshold(ObjectName)`. Here's an example of how you can refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
CounterMonitor monitor = new CounterMonitor();
monitor.setThreshold(100);
long threshold = monitor.getThreshold();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
CounterMonitor monitor = new CounterMonitor();
monitor.setThreshold(100);
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("your.package.name:type=YourType");
long threshold = monitor.getThreshold(objectName);
```

In the refactored code, we are using the `getThreshold(ObjectName)` method instead of the deprecated `getThreshold()` method. We are also passing an `ObjectName` parameter to the `getThreshold()` method, which is required in JMX 1.2 and later versions.
