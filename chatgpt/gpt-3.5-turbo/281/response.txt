Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor(mbeanServer, objectName, counterAttribute);
counterMonitor.setThreshold(threshold);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor(mbeanServer, objectName, counterAttribute);
counterMonitor.setInitThreshold(threshold);
```
