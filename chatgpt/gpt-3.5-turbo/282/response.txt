I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to refactor your code based on the deprecation message you provided.

The deprecation message suggests that you should replace the use of the `getDerivedGauge()` method with the `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` method. Here's an example of how you could refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
// ...
double derivedGauge = counterMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
// ...
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
// ...
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=CounterMonitor");
double derivedGauge = counterMonitor.getDerivedGauge(objectName);
// ...
```

In this example, we've replaced the call to `getDerivedGauge()` with a call to `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)`. We've also created an `ObjectName` instance to pass as an argument to the method. You'll need to replace `"com.example:type=CounterMonitor"` with the actual object name of your `CounterMonitor` instance.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
