Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
long derivedGaugeTimeStamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
ObjectName objectName = counterMonitor.getObservedObject();
long derivedGaugeTimeStamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
``` 

In the refactored code, we first get the `ObjectName` of the observed object using the `getObservedObject()` method. Then, we pass this `ObjectName` to the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method to get the derived gauge timestamp. This is in line with the deprecation comment in the Javadoc, which recommends using the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method instead of the deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method.
