Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class MyMonitor {
    private CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor;
    
    public void checkThreshold() {
        long threshold = counterMonitor.getThreshold();
        // do something with threshold
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import javax.management.ObjectName;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class MyMonitor {
    private CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor;
    
    public void checkThreshold() {
        ObjectName objectName = counterMonitor.getObservedObject();
        long threshold = counterMonitor.getThreshold(objectName);
        // do something with threshold
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `getThreshold()` method with the recommended `getThreshold(ObjectName)` method. We first get the `ObjectName` of the observed object using the `getObservedObject()` method, and then pass that `ObjectName` to the `getThreshold()` method to get the threshold value.
