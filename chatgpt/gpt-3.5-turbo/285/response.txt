I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to any specific codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
counterMonitor.setThreshold(100);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
counterMonitor.setInitThreshold(100);
```

In this example, we replaced the deprecated `setThreshold` method with the new `setInitThreshold` method, which is the recommended replacement according to the Javadoc comment. This should ensure that your code continues to work as expected while also being up-to-date with the latest best practices.
