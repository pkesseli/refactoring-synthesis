Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitor gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor(mBeanServerConnection, objectName, gaugeMBean);
Number derivedGauge = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitor gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor(mBeanServerConnection, objectName, gaugeMBean);
ObjectName derivedGaugeObjectName = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGaugeObjectName();
Number derivedGauge = (Number) mBeanServerConnection.getAttribute(derivedGaugeObjectName, "Value");
``` 

In the refactored code, we use the `getDerivedGaugeObjectName()` method instead of the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method. This returns an `ObjectName` that we can use to retrieve the derived gauge value using the `getAttribute()` method on the `MBeanServerConnection`.
