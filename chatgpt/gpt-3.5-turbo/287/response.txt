Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitor monitor = new GaugeMonitor(mbeanServer, objectName, gaugeMBean, threshold);
long timeStamp = monitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitor monitor = new GaugeMonitor(mbeanServer, objectName, gaugeMBean, threshold);
ObjectName derivedGauge = monitor.getDerivedGauge();
long timeStamp = (long) mbeanServer.getAttribute(derivedGauge, "TimeStamp");
``` 

In the refactored code, we first create a `GaugeMonitor` object with the necessary parameters. Then, instead of calling the deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method, we call the new `getDerivedGauge()` method to get the `ObjectName` of the derived gauge. Finally, we use the `MBeanServer` to get the `TimeStamp` attribute of the derived gauge and assign it to the `timeStamp` variable.
