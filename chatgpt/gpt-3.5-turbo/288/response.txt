I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to a specific codebase to provide a refactoring example. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor deprecated code.

When refactoring deprecated code, you should first identify the replacement method or class that should be used instead. In this case, the replacement method is GaugeMonitorMBean.getDerivedGauge(ObjectName).

Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitorMBean gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor();
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyMonitor");
Number derivedGauge = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitorMBean gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor();
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyMonitor");
Number derivedGauge = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGauge(objectName);
```

In this example, we've simply replaced the call to the deprecated method with a call to the replacement method, passing in the appropriate ObjectName parameter.
