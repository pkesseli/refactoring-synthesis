The method javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JMX 1.2, replaced by GaugeMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
