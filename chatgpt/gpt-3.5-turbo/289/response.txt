I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or know the context of your project. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor your code based on the deprecation warning you mentioned.

The deprecation warning suggests that you should replace the use of the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method with the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method. Here's an example of how you could refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitorMBean gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor();
long timeStamp = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitorMBean gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor();
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=GaugeMonitor");
long timeStamp = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
```

In this example, we create a new `ObjectName` instance that represents the `GaugeMonitor` MBean, and then pass it to the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method. This should allow you to use the updated method without any issues.
