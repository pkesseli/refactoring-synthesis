Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public void lostFocus(Event evt, Object obj) {
    // do something when component loses focus
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent evt) {
    if (evt.getID() == FocusEvent.FOCUS_LOST) {
        // do something when component loses focus
    }
}
```
