I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method using the suggested replacement.

Before refactoring:
```
Monitor monitor = new Monitor();
Object observedObject = monitor.getObservedObject();
```

After refactoring:
```
Monitor monitor = new Monitor();
Object[] observedObjects = monitor.getObservedObjects();
Object observedObject = observedObjects[0];
```

In the refactored code, we create a new `Monitor` object and call the `getObservedObjects()` method, which returns an array of objects being monitored. Since the deprecated `getObservedObject()` method only returned a single object, we can simply access the first element of the array to get the same result.
