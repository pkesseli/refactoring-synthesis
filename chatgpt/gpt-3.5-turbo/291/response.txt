Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Monitor monitor = new Monitor();
ObjectName observedObject = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyMBean");
monitor.setObservedObject(observedObject);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Monitor monitor = new Monitor();
ObjectName observedObject = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyMBean");
monitor.addObservedObject(observedObject);
``` 

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `setObservedObject` method with the recommended `addObservedObject` method. This should ensure that our code remains compatible with future versions of JMX.
