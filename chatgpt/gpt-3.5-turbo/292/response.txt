I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method using the suggested replacement method.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
MonitorMBean monitor = new Monitor();
Object observedObject = monitor.getObservedObject();
```
>>> After refactoring: 
```
MonitorMBean monitor = new Monitor();
Object[] observedObjects = monitor.getObservedObjects();
Object observedObject = observedObjects[0];
``` 

In the above example, we first create a `MonitorMBean` object and then call the deprecated `getObservedObject()` method to get the observed object. After refactoring, we call the suggested replacement method `getObservedObjects()` which returns an array of observed objects. We then retrieve the first object from the array to get the same result as before.
