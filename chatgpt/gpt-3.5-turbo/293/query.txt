The method javax.management.monitor.MonitorMBean.setObservedObject​(ObjectName) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JMX 1.2, replaced by MonitorMBean.addObservedObject(javax.management.ObjectName)"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
