I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to a specific codebase to provide a refactoring example. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method.

The deprecation comment suggests that you should replace the deprecated method with the new method `StringMonitorMBean.getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)`. Therefore, you should update your code to use the new method instead of the deprecated one.

Here's an example of how you can refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
// ...
String derivedGauge = stringMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
// ...
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("your.package.name:type=StringMonitor");
String derivedGauge = stringMonitor.getDerivedGauge(objectName);
```

In this example, we create an instance of `StringMonitorMBean` and then call the deprecated method `getDerivedGauge()`. After refactoring, we create an `ObjectName` instance that represents the `StringMonitorMBean` and then call the new method `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` with the `ObjectName` instance as an argument.
