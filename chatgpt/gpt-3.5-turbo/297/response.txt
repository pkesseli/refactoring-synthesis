I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to refactor your code based on the deprecation comment you provided.

The deprecation comment suggests that you should replace the usage of the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method with the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method. Here's an example of how you can refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
long timeStamp = stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("your.package.name:type=StringMonitor");
long timeStamp = stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
```

In the refactored code, we create an `ObjectName` instance that represents the `StringMonitor` MBean and pass it as an argument to the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method. This should replace the usage of the deprecated method and ensure that your code is compatible with JMX 1.2 and later versions.
