The method javax.management.ValueExp.setMBeanServer​(MBeanServer) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is not needed because a
 ValueExp can access the MBean server in which it
 is being evaluated by using QueryEval.getMBeanServer()."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.setMBeanServer​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
