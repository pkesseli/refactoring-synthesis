I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Component.minimumSize()` to use the recommended method `getMinimumSize()`.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
Dimension minimumSize = component.minimumSize();
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
Dimension minimumSize = component.getMinimumSize();
``` 

This is a simple example of how to refactor the deprecated method to use the recommended method. However, it's important to note that the specific refactoring steps may vary depending on the context and complexity of your code.
