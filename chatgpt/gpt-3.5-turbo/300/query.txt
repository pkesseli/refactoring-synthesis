The method javax.net.ssl.HandshakeCompletedEvent.getPeerCertificateChain() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The HandshakeCompletedEvent.getPeerCertificates() method that returns an
               array of java.security.cert.Certificate should
               be used instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
