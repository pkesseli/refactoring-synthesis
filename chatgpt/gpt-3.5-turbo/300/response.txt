Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
HandshakeCompletedEvent event = ...;
X509Certificate[] peerCertificates = (X509Certificate[]) event.getPeerCertificateChain();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
HandshakeCompletedEvent event = ...;
Certificate[] peerCertificates = event.getPeerCertificates();
X509Certificate[] x509Certificates = Arrays.copyOf(peerCertificates, peerCertificates.length, X509Certificate[].class);
```
