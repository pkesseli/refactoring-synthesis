The method javax.sql.rowset.BaseRowSet.setUnicodeStreamâ€‹(int, InputStream, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "getCharacterStream should be used in its place"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
