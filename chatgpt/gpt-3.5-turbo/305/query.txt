The method javax.swing.FocusManager.disableSwingFocusManager() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "as of 1.4, replaced by
 KeyboardFocusManager.setDefaultFocusTraversalPolicy(FocusTraversalPolicy)"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
