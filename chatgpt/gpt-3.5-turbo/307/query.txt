The method javax.swing.InputVerifier.shouldYieldFocus​(JComponent) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "use InputVerifier.shouldYieldFocus(JComponent, JComponent)
 instead."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.shouldYieldFocus​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
