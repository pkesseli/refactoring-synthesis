The method javax.swing.InputVerifier.shouldYieldFocus​(JComponent) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "use InputVerifier.shouldYieldFocus(JComponent, JComponent)
 instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
