Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or programming language. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor a deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
public class MyInputVerifier extends InputVerifier {
    @Override
    public boolean shouldYieldFocus(JComponent input) {
        // do some verification
        return true;
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
public class MyInputVerifier extends InputVerifier {
    @Override
    public boolean shouldYieldFocus(JComponent input, JComponent target) {
        // do some verification
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this example, we updated the `shouldYieldFocus` method to use the new signature that includes a `target` parameter. This is the recommended way to refactor the code to use the new method and avoid the deprecated one.
