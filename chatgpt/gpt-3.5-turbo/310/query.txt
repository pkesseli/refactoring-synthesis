The method javax.swing.JComponent.getNextFocusableComponent() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of 1.4, replaced by FocusTraversalPolicy."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
