Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JButton button1 = new JButton("Button 1");
JButton button2 = new JButton("Button 2");
button1.setNextFocusableComponent(button2);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JButton button1 = new JButton("Button 1");
JButton button2 = new JButton("Button 2");
button1.setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider(true);
button1.setFocusTraversalPolicy(new LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy() {
    public Component getDefaultComponent(Container focusCycleRoot) {
        return button2;
    }
});
``` 

In the refactored code, we use `setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider(true)` to indicate that this component provides its own focus traversal policy. We then create a new `LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy` and override its `getDefaultComponent` method to return the next focusable component, which in this case is `button2`. This ensures that when the user presses the Tab key, focus will move from `button1` to `button2`.
