The method javax.swing.JComponent.reshape​(int, int, int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK 5,
 replaced by Component.setBounds(int, int, int, int).
 
 Moves and resizes this component."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.reshape​(a, b, c, d)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
