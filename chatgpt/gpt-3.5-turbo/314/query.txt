The method javax.swing.JComponent.reshapeâ€‹(int, int, int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK 5,
 replaced by Component.setBounds(int, int, int, int).
 
 Moves and resizes this component."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
