The method javax.swing.JList.getSelectedValues() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK 1.7, replaced by JList.getSelectedValuesList()"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
