I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Component.mouseDrag(Event, int, int)` to the recommended method `processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent)`.

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public void mouseDrag(Event evt, int x, int y) {
    // code here
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public void processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent evt) {
    if (evt.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_DRAGGED) {
        int x = evt.getX();
        int y = evt.getY();
        // code here
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `mouseDrag` method with the recommended `processMouseMotionEvent` method. We also added a check to ensure that the event is a `MOUSE_DRAGGED` event before executing the code block. Finally, we extracted the `x` and `y` coordinates from the `MouseEvent` object and passed them as arguments to the code block.
