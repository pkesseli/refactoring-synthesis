Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
String password = passwordField.getText();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
char[] passwordChars = passwordField.getPassword();
String password = new String(passwordChars);
```
