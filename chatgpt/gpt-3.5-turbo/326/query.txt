The method javax.swing.JTable.sizeColumnsToFitâ€‹(boolean) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of Swing version 1.0.3,
 replaced by doLayout()."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
