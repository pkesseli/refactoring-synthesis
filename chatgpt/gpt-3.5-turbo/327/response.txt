I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method using the suggested replacement:

<<< Before refactoring: 
boolean isBackingStoreEnabled = viewport.isBackingStoreEnabled();

>>> After refactoring: 
int scrollMode = viewport.getScrollMode();
boolean isBackingStoreEnabled = scrollMode == JViewport.BACKINGSTORE_SCROLL_MODE || 
                                scrollMode == JViewport.SIMPLE_SCROLL_MODE;
