I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor your code based on the deprecation warning you mentioned.

The deprecation warning suggests that you should replace the use of the `mouseEnter` method with the `processMouseEvent` method. Here's an example of how you could refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void mouseEnter(Event evt, int x, int y) {
        // Do something when the mouse enters the component
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void processMouseEvent(MouseEvent evt) {
        if (evt.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_ENTERED) {
            // Do something when the mouse enters the component
        }
        super.processMouseEvent(evt);
    }
}
```

In this example, we've replaced the `mouseEnter` method with the `processMouseEvent` method. We've also added a check to see if the event ID is `MouseEvent.MOUSE_ENTERED`, which indicates that the mouse has entered the component. If the event ID matches, we perform the same action that we were doing in the `mouseEnter` method. Finally, we call the `super.processMouseEvent` method to ensure that any other mouse events are handled correctly.
