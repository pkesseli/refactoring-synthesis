I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor deprecated code.

When you encounter deprecated code, the first step is to check the documentation to see if there is a recommended replacement. If there is, you should use the recommended replacement. If there isn't, you should try to find an alternative solution that achieves the same functionality.

In the case of the deprecated method javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneUI.createKeyboardDownRightListener(), you should look for an alternative method that achieves the same functionality. If you can't find one, you may need to write your own implementation.

Here's an example of how you might refactor the code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
BasicSplitPaneUI ui = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
ui.createKeyboardDownRightListener();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
BasicSplitPaneUI ui = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
// Replace deprecated method with alternative implementation
ui.getHandler().getKeyboardDownRightHandler();
``` 

Again, this is just an example, and the specific refactoring will depend on the context of your code.
