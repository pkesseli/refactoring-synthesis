I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide some general guidance on how to refactor deprecated code.

When a method or class is deprecated, it means that it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions of the software. To refactor deprecated code, you should replace the deprecated method or class with a recommended alternative.

In the case of the javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneUI.createKeyboardEndListener() method, you should look for an alternative method that provides similar functionality. You can start by checking the Java documentation or searching online for recommendations.

Once you have identified an alternative method, you can replace the deprecated method with the recommended one. Here's an example of what the refactored code might look like:

<<< Before refactoring:
BasicSplitPaneUI ui = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
ui.createKeyboardEndListener();

>>> After refactoring:
BasicSplitPaneUI ui = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
ui.getKeyboardEndHandler();
