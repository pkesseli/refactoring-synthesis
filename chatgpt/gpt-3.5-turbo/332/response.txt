I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can suggest some general steps you can take to refactor the deprecated method:

1. Identify the purpose of the deprecated method and find a suitable replacement method or approach.
2. Update the code to use the replacement method or approach.
3. Test the updated code to ensure it works as expected.

Here's an example of how you might refactor the code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.createKeyboardHomeListener();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.getHandler().home();
```

In this example, we've replaced the deprecated `createKeyboardHomeListener()` method with the `getHandler().home()` method, which achieves the same result.
