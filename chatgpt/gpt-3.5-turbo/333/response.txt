I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor deprecated code.

When you encounter deprecated code, you should first check the documentation to see if there is a recommended replacement. If there is, you should use the recommended replacement. If there isn't, you should try to find an alternative solution that achieves the same functionality.

In the case of the deprecated method javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneUI.createKeyboardResizeToggleListener(), you could try using the method createToggleKeyBinding() instead. Here's an example of how you could refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.createKeyboardResizeToggleListener();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.createToggleKeyBinding(KeyEvent.VK_TAB, 0, false);
```

This code creates a new instance of BasicSplitPaneUI and then uses the createToggleKeyBinding() method to create a toggle key binding for the TAB key. This achieves the same functionality as the deprecated createKeyboardResizeToggleListener() method.
