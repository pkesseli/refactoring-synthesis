The method javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneUI.getDividerBorderSize() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of Java 2 platform v1.3, instead set the border on the
 divider."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
