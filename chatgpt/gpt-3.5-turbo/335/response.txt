I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to a specific codebase to provide a refactoring example. However, I can give you some general advice on how to refactor deprecated code.

When you encounter deprecated code, you should first check the deprecation comment in the Javadoc to see if there is a recommended alternative. In this case, the comment suggests setting the border on the divider instead of using the deprecated method.

Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
BasicSplitPaneUI ui = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
int borderSize = ui.getDividerBorderSize();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
BasicSplitPaneUI ui = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
Border border = BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(0, 0, 0, 0);
ui.getDivider().setBorder(border);
``` 

In this example, we create an empty border and set it on the divider using the `setBorder()` method. This achieves the same result as the deprecated `getDividerBorderSize()` method without using deprecated code.
