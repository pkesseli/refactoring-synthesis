Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point point = new Point(10, 20);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int modelIndex = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel(textComponent, point, bias);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point2D point = new Point2D.Double(10, 20);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int modelIndex = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel2D(textComponent, point, bias);
``` 

In this example, we've updated the code to use the `viewToModel2D` method instead of the deprecated `viewToModel` method. We've also updated the `Point` object to a `Point2D` object, which is required by the new method.
