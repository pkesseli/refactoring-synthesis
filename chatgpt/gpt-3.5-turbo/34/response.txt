I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor your code based on the deprecation warning you mentioned.

The deprecation warning suggests that you should replace the use of the `mouseExit` method with the `processMouseEvent` method. Here's an example of how you could refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void mouseExit(Event evt, int x, int y) {
        // do something
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void processMouseEvent(MouseEvent evt) {
        if (evt.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_EXITED) {
            // do something
        }
        super.processMouseEvent(evt);
    }
}
```

In this example, we've replaced the `mouseExit` method with the `processMouseEvent` method. We've also added a check to see if the event ID is `MouseEvent.MOUSE_EXITED`, which is equivalent to the old `mouseExit` method. Finally, we've called the `super.processMouseEvent(evt)` method to ensure that any other event processing is still performed.
