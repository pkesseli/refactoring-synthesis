The method javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalScrollPaneUI.uninstallListenersâ€‹(JScrollPane) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "- Replaced by BasicScrollPaneUI.uninstallListeners(JComponent)"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
