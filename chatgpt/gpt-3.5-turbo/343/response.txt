Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
int pos = 5;
Rectangle rect = multiTextUI.modelToView(textComponent, pos);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
int pos = 5;
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
Rectangle rect = textComponent.getUI().modelToView2D(textComponent, pos, bias);
``` 

In the refactored code, we use the `modelToView2D` method instead of the deprecated `modelToView` method. We also pass in a `Position.Bias` array to the method, which is required by the new method signature.
