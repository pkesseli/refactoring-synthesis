Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
MultiTextUI multiTextUI = new MultiTextUI();
int pos = 5;
Position.Bias bias = Position.Bias.Forward;
Rectangle rect = multiTextUI.modelToView(textComponent, pos, bias);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
int pos = 5;
Position.Bias bias = Position.Bias.Forward;
Rectangle rect = textUI.modelToView2D(textComponent, pos, bias);
```

In the refactored code, we first get the `TextUI` object from the `JTextComponent` using the `getUI()` method. Then, we call the `modelToView2D()` method on the `TextUI` object, passing in the `JTextComponent`, position, and bias as parameters. This replaces the deprecated `modelToView()` method on the `MultiTextUI` object.
