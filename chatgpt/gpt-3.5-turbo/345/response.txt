Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Point point = new Point(x, y);
int pos = textComponent.viewToModel(point);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Point point = new Point(x, y);
int pos = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel(textComponent, point);
``` 

In the refactored code, we're using the `getUI()` method to get the `TextUI` object associated with the `JTextComponent`, and then calling the `viewToModel()` method on that object instead of directly on the `JTextComponent`. This avoids using the deprecated `MultiTextUI` class and ensures that the code will continue to work correctly in future versions of Java.
