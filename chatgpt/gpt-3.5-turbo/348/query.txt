The method javax.swing.plaf.TextUI.modelToViewâ€‹(JTextComponent, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     TextUI.modelToView2D(JTextComponent, int, Position.Bias)"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
