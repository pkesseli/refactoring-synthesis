Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
Rectangle rect = null;
try {
    rect = textUI.modelToView(textComponent, 5);
} catch (BadLocationException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
Rectangle2D rect = null;
try {
    rect = textUI.modelToView2D(textComponent, 5, Position.Bias.Forward);
} catch (BadLocationException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
``` 

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `modelToView` method with the recommended `modelToView2D` method, passing in the `JTextComponent`, the index to convert, and the `Position.Bias` to use. We've also changed the type of the `rect` variable to `Rectangle2D`, which is the return type of the new method.
