I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Component.mouseMove(Event, int, int)` to the recommended method `processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent)`.

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public void mouseMoved(Event e, int x, int y) {
    // Do something with the mouse move event
    this.mouseMove(e, x, y);
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e) {
    // Do something with the mouse move event
    this.processMouseMotionEvent(e);
}
```

In this example, we have replaced the deprecated `mouseMove(Event, int, int)` method with the recommended `processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent)` method. We have also updated the method signature to accept a `MouseEvent` object instead of an `Event` object and two integers. This allows us to access all the information contained in the `MouseEvent` object, which is more comprehensive than the deprecated `Event` object.
