Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point point = new Point(10, 20);
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
int modelIndex = textUI.viewToModel(textComponent, point);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point2D point = new Point2D.Double(10, 20);
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int modelIndex = textUI.viewToModel2D(textComponent, point, bias);
``` 

In this example, we've replaced the deprecated `TextUI.viewToModel` method with the recommended `TextUI.viewToModel2D` method. We've also updated the `Point` object to a `Point2D` object and added a `Position.Bias` array to the method call.
