The method javax.swing.RepaintManager.addDirtyRegionâ€‹(Applet, int, int, int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The Applet API is deprecated. See the
  java.applet package
 documentation for further information."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
