The method javax.swing.ScrollPaneLayout.getViewportBorderBoundsâ€‹(JScrollPane) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version Swing1.1
    replaced by JScrollPane.getViewportBorderBounds()."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
