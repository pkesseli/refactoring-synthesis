Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can suggest a refactoring approach for the deprecated method.

Before refactoring:
```
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
ScrollPaneLayout layout = (ScrollPaneLayout) scrollPane.getLayout();
Rectangle viewportBorderBounds = layout.getViewportBorderBounds(scrollPane);
```

After refactoring:
```
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
Rectangle viewportBorderBounds = scrollPane.getViewportBorderBounds();
``` 

By calling the `getViewportBorderBounds()` method directly on the `JScrollPane` instance, you can avoid using the deprecated `getViewportBorderBounds()` method from the `ScrollPaneLayout` class.
