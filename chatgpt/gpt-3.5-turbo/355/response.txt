I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can suggest a possible refactoring example based on the deprecation comment you provided:

<<< Before refactoring: 
javax.swing.table.TableColumn.disableResizedPosting();

>>> After refactoring: 
Instead of using the deprecated method, you can use the setResizable() method to disable resizing of the column. Here's an example code block:

javax.swing.table.TableColumn column = table.getColumnModel().getColumn(columnIndex);
column.setResizable(false);
