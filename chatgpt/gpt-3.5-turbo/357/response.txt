I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to a specific codebase to provide a refactoring example. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor deprecated code:

1. Identify the deprecated code and the recommended replacement.
2. Replace the deprecated code with the recommended replacement.
3. Test the refactored code to ensure that it works as expected.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the deprecated code you mentioned:

<<< Before refactoring: 
javax.swing.text.html.HTMLEditorKit.InsertHTMLTextAction.insertAtBoundry​(JEditorPane, HTMLDocument, int, Element, String, HTML.Tag, HTML.Tag)
 
>>> After refactoring: 
javax.swing.text.html.HTMLEditorKit.InsertHTMLTextAction.insertAtBoundary​(JEditorPane, HTMLDocument, int, Element, String, HTML.Tag, HTML.Tag)
