I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Component.mouseUp(Event, int, int)` to the recommended method `processMouseEvent(MouseEvent)`.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
public void mouseUp(Event evt, int x, int y) {
    // do something
}
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
public void processMouseEvent(MouseEvent evt) {
    if (evt.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED) {
        int x = evt.getX();
        int y = evt.getY();
        // do something
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `mouseUp` method with the recommended `processMouseEvent` method. We also added a check to ensure that the event is a mouse release event before executing the code. Finally, we extracted the x and y coordinates from the `MouseEvent` object instead of passing them as parameters.
