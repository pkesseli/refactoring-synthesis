The method javax.swing.text.LabelView.getFontMetrics() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "FontMetrics are not used for glyph rendering
  when running in the JDK."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
