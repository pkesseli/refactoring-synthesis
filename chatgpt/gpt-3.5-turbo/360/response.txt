I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or context. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor code that uses deprecated methods.

When a method is deprecated, it means that it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions of the software. In this case, the deprecation comment suggests that the FontMetrics class is no longer necessary for glyph rendering in the JDK.

To refactor code that uses the deprecated javax.swing.text.LabelView.getFontMetrics() method, you could consider using an alternative method that achieves the same functionality. One option might be to use the Graphics2D.getFontMetrics() method instead, which returns a FontMetrics object that can be used for glyph rendering.

Here's an example of how you might refactor code that uses the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
FontMetrics fontMetrics = labelView.getFontMetrics();

>>> After refactoring:
FontMetrics fontMetrics = graphics2D.getFontMetrics(); 

Of course, this is just an example, and the specific refactoring you need to do will depend on your codebase and requirements. It's always a good idea to consult the documentation and seek advice from experienced developers when refactoring code.
