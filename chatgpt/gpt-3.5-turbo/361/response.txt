Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or programming language. However, I can provide you with a general refactoring example:

Before refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.text.PasswordView;

public class LoginView extends PasswordView {
    public void drawEchoCharacter(Graphics g, int x, int y, char c) {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.text.PasswordView;
import java.awt.Graphics2D;

public class LoginView extends PasswordView {
    public void drawEchoCharacter(Graphics2D g, float x, float y, char c) {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

In this example, the `drawEchoCharacter` method in the `LoginView` class is updated to use the new `drawEchoCharacter` method in `PasswordView` that takes a `Graphics2D` object instead of a `Graphics` object. This is done to avoid using the deprecated method and to ensure that the code is up-to-date with the latest API changes.
