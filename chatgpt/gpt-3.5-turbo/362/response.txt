I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or know what programming language you are using. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor deprecated code:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
import javax.swing.text.PasswordView;

public class Example {
    public void drawPasswordView(PasswordView passwordView, Graphics graphics, int x, int y, int width, int height) {
        passwordView.drawSelectedText(graphics, x, y, width, height);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
import javax.swing.text.PlainView;

public class Example {
    public void drawPasswordView(PlainView plainView, Graphics2D graphics, float x, float y, int startOffset, int endOffset) {
        plainView.drawSelectedText(graphics, x, y, startOffset, endOffset);
    }
}
```

In this example, we replaced the deprecated `PasswordView.drawSelectedText` method with the recommended `PlainView.drawSelectedText` method. We also updated the method signature to match the new method's parameters.
