Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method call based on the information you provided:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
PlainView view = new PlainView();
Graphics graphics = new Graphics();
view.drawLine(0, graphics, 10, 10);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
PlainView view = new PlainView();
Graphics2D graphics = (Graphics2D) graphics;
view.drawLine(0, graphics, 10.0f, 10.0f);
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `drawLine(int, Graphics, int, int)` method with the new `drawLine(int, Graphics2D, float, float)` method. We have also cast the `Graphics` object to `Graphics2D` to use the new method.
