The method javax.swing.text.TableView.createTableCellâ€‹(Element) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Table cells can now be any arbitrary
 View implementation and should be produced by the
 ViewFactory rather than the table."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
