Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or programming language. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor a deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
int position = Utilities.getPositionAbove(textComponent, offset, height);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
float lineHeight = textComponent.getFontMetrics(textComponent.getFont()).getHeight();
int position = Utilities.getPositionAbove(textComponent, offset, lineHeight);
``` 

In this example, we replaced the deprecated method `Utilities.getPositionAbove(JTextComponent, int, int)` with the new method `Utilities.getPositionAbove(JTextComponent, int, float)`. We calculated the `lineHeight` using the `getFontMetrics()` method and passed it as a `float` argument to the new method.
