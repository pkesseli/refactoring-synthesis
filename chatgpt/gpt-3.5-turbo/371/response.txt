Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
int pos = Utilities.getPositionBelow(textComponent, offset, 10);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
float maxDescent = 10f;
int pos = Utilities.getPositionBelow(textComponent, offset, maxDescent);
``` 

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated method call with the new one that takes a `float` instead of an `int` for the maximum descent. We've also updated the code to pass in a `float` value for `maxDescent` instead of an `int`.
