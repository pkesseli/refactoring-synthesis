The method javax.swing.text.Utilities.getTabbedTextOffsetâ€‹(Segment, FontMetrics, int, int, TabExpander, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     Utilities.getTabbedTextOffset(Segment, FontMetrics, float, float,
                                 TabExpander, int, boolean)"
