The method javax.swing.text.Utilities.getTabbedTextOffset​(Segment, FontMetrics, int, int, TabExpander, int, boolean) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     Utilities.getTabbedTextOffset(Segment, FontMetrics, float, float,
                                 TabExpander, int, boolean)"
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.getTabbedTextOffset​(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
