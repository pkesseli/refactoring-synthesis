The method javax.swing.text.Utilities.getTabbedTextWidth​(Segment, FontMetrics, int, TabExpander, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     Utilities.getTabbedTextWidth(Segment, FontMetrics, float, TabExpander, int)"
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.getTabbedTextWidth​(a, b, c, d, e)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
