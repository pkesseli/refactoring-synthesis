Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
int pos = 10;
view.modelToView(pos, rect);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Rectangle rect = view.modelToView(pos);
``` 

In the refactored code, we're using the `modelToView(int)` method instead of the deprecated `modelToView(int, Shape)` method. This simplifies the code and removes the need to create a `Rectangle` object to pass as a parameter.
