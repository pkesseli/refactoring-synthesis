Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
int offset = view.viewToModel(x, y, bounds);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Point2D.Float point = new Point2D.Float(x, y);
int offset = view.viewToModel(point, bounds, Position.Bias.Forward);
``` 

In the refactored code, we create a `Point2D.Float` object to represent the coordinates of the view, and pass it along with the `bounds` parameter and a `Position.Bias` value to the updated `viewToModel()` method. This avoids using the deprecated method and ensures that the code will continue to work correctly in future versions of Java.
