I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or know what programming language you are using. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor deprecated code:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
import javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView;

public class MyView extends WrappedPlainView {
    @Override
    public void paint(Graphics g, Shape a) {
        super.paint(g, a);
        drawLine(0, 0, g, 10, 10);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
import javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView;
import java.awt.Graphics2D;

public class MyView extends WrappedPlainView {
    @Override
    public void paint(Graphics g, Shape a) {
        super.paint(g, a);
        Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;
        drawLine(0, 0, g2d, 10f, 10f);
    }
}
``` 

In this example, we have refactored the deprecated `drawLine` method by replacing the `Graphics` parameter with a `Graphics2D` parameter and replacing the `int` coordinates with `float` coordinates. This is in line with the updated method signature provided in the deprecation comment.
