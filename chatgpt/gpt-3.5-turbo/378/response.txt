I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method call based on the information you provided.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView view = new javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView();
Graphics graphics = new Graphics();
int start = 0;
int end = 10;
view.drawSelectedText(graphics, start, end, 0, 0);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView view = new javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView();
Graphics2D graphics = (Graphics2D) graphics;
float start = 0.0f;
float end = 10.0f;
view.drawSelectedText(graphics, start, end, 0, 0);
``` 

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated method `drawSelectedText(Graphics, int, int, int, int)` with the new method `drawSelectedText(Graphics2D, float, float, int, int)` as suggested in the Javadoc comment. We have also cast the `Graphics` object to `Graphics2D` to use the new method.
