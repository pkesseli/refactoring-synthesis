I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or know what programming language you are using. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor deprecated code:

<<< Before refactoring: 
javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView.drawUnselectedTextâ€‹(g, x, y, startOffset, endOffset);
 
>>> After refactoring: 
Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;
javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView.drawUnselectedText(g2d, x, y, startOffset, endOffset); 

In this example, we cast the Graphics object to a Graphics2D object and pass it to the new method. This will ensure that the new method is used instead of the deprecated one.
