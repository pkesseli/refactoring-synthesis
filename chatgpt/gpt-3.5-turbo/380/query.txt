The method javax.swing.tree.DefaultTreeSelectionModel.notifyPathChangeâ€‹(Vector&lt;?&gt;, TreePath) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.7"
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
