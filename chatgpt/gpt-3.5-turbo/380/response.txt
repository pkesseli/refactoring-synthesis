Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
DefaultTreeSelectionModel selectionModel = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel();
Vector<TreePath> paths = new Vector<>();
TreePath path = new TreePath(new Object[] { "root", "child1" });
paths.add(path);
selectionModel.notifyPathChange(paths, path);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
DefaultTreeSelectionModel selectionModel = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel();
TreePath path = new TreePath(new Object[] { "root", "child1" });
selectionModel.setSelectionPath(path);
```
