The method javax.tools.StandardJavaFileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromPathsâ€‹(Iterable&lt;? extends Path&gt;) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "use StandardJavaFileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromPaths(Collection) instead,
 to prevent the possibility of accidentally calling the method with a
 single Path as such an argument. Although Path implements
 Iterable<Path>, it would almost never be correct to pass a single
 Path and have it be treated as an Iterable of its
 components."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
