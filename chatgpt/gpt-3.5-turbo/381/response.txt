Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to a specific codebase to provide a refactoring example. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method.

Before refactoring:
```
Iterable<Path> paths = ...;
StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);
Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject> fileObjects = fileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromPaths(paths);
```

After refactoring:
```
Collection<Path> paths = ...;
StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);
Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject> fileObjects = fileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromPaths(paths);
``` 

In the refactored code, the `Iterable<Path>` has been changed to `Collection<Path>` to prevent accidentally passing a single `Path` object. This change ensures that the method is called correctly and avoids any potential issues that may arise from using a single `Path` object as an iterable.
