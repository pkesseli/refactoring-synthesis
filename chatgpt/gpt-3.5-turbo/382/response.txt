Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
ClassLoader toolClassLoader = ToolProvider.getSystemToolClassLoader();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
ClassLoader toolClassLoader = ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader();
``` 

Note: This is just a simple example and may not be applicable in all cases. It's important to carefully consider the specific use case and follow the guidance provided in the deprecation comment.
