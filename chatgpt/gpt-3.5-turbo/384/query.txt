The method javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory.newInstanceâ€‹(String, ClassLoader) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has been deprecated to maintain API consistency.
              All newInstance methods have been replaced with corresponding
              newFactory methods. The replacement XMLInputFactory.newFactory(java.lang.String, java.lang.ClassLoader) method
              defines no changes in behavior."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
