Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method using the newFactory method:

Before refactoring:
```
XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance("com.sun.xml.internal.stream.XMLInputFactoryImpl", null);
```

After refactoring:
```
XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newFactory("com.sun.xml.internal.stream.XMLInputFactoryImpl", null);
``` 

By using the newFactory method, you can achieve the same behavior as the deprecated newInstance method while maintaining API consistency.
