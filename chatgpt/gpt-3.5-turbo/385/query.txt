The method javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory.newInstanceâ€‹(String, ClassLoader) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has been deprecated because it returns an
              instance of XMLInputFactory, which is of the wrong class.
              Use the new method XMLOutputFactory.newFactory(java.lang.String,
              java.lang.ClassLoader) instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
