Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
XMLOutputFactory factory = XMLOutputFactory.newInstance();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
XMLOutputFactory factory = XMLOutputFactory.newFactory(
    XMLOutputFactory.DEFAULT_FACTORY_CLASS_NAME, 
    Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()
);
```
