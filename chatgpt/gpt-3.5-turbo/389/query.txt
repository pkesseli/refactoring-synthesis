The method org.ietf.jgss.GSSContext.unwrap​(InputStream, OutputStream, MessageProp) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The stream-based methods have been removed from RFC 8353.
 Use GSSContext.unwrap(byte[], int, int, MessageProp) instead."
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.unwrap​(a, b, c)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
