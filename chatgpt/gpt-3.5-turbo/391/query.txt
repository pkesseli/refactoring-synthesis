The method org.ietf.jgss.GSSContext.wrapâ€‹(InputStream, OutputStream, MessageProp) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The stream-based methods have been removed from RFC 8353.
 Use GSSContext.wrap(byte[], int, int, MessageProp) instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
