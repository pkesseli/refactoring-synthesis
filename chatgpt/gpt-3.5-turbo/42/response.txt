I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Component.resize(int, int)` to `java.awt.Component.setSize(int, int)`.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
Component component = new Component();
component.resize(500, 500);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
Component component = new Component();
component.setSize(500, 500);
``` 

In this example, the deprecated `resize(int, int)` method is replaced with the recommended `setSize(int, int)` method. This will ensure that the code remains compatible with future versions of Java and avoids any potential issues that may arise from using deprecated methods.
