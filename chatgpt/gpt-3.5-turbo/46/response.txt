Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void doSomething() {
        int width = size().width;
        int height = size().height;
        // do something with width and height
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void doSomething() {
        Dimension size = getSize();
        int width = size.width;
        int height = size.height;
        // do something with width and height
    }
}
```

In this example, we've replaced the deprecated `size()` method with the recommended `getSize()` method. We've also updated the code to use the `Dimension` class to store the component's size, rather than accessing the `width` and `height` fields directly. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.
