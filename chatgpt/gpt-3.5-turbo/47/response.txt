Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method using the suggested replacement.

>>> After refactoring: 
java.awt.ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(Locale.getDefault());
