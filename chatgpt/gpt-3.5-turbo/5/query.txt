The method com.sun.source.tree.CaseTree.getExpression() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Please use CaseTree.getExpressions()."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
