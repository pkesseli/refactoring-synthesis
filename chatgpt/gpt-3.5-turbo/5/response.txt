Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
CaseTree caseTree = ...;
ExpressionTree expressionTree = caseTree.getExpression();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
CaseTree caseTree = ...;
List<? extends ExpressionTree> expressionTrees = caseTree.getExpressions();
ExpressionTree expressionTree = expressionTrees.get(0);
``` 

In the refactored code, we first call `caseTree.getExpressions()` to get a list of all the expressions associated with the case. Since the `getExpressions()` method returns a list, we can access the first expression by calling `expressionTrees.get(0)`. This achieves the same result as the original code, but avoids using the deprecated `getExpression()` method.
