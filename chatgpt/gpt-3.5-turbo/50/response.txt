Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.awt.Container.insets()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Container container = new Container();
Insets insets = container.insets();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Container container = new Container();
Insets insets = container.getInsets();
```
