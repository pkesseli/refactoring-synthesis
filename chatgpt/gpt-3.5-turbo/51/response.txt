I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Container.layout()` to `doLayout()`.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
Container container = new Container();
container.layout();
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
Container container = new Container();
container.doLayout();
``` 

Please note that this is just an example, and the actual refactoring process may vary depending on your specific use case. It's always a good practice to consult the official documentation and best practices before making any changes to your code.
