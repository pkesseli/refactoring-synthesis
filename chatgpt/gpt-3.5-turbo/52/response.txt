Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Container container = new Container();
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
Component component = container.locate(x, y);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Container container = new Container();
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
Component component = container.getComponentAt(x, y);
```
