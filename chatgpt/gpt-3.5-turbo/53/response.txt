I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or context. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor deprecated code using the information you provided:

Before refactoring: 

```
Container container = new Container();
Dimension minimumSize = container.minimumSize();
```

After refactoring: 

```
Container container = new Container();
Dimension minimumSize = container.getMinimumSize();
```

In this example, we replaced the deprecated `minimumSize()` method with the recommended `getMinimumSize()` method.
