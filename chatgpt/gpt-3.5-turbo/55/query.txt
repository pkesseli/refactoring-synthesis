The method java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor.equals​(String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As inconsistent with hashCode() contract, use
             DataFlavor.isMimeTypeEqual(String) instead."

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
