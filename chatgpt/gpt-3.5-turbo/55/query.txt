The method java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor.equalsâ€‹(String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As inconsistent with hashCode() contract, use
             DataFlavor.isMimeTypeEqual(String) instead."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
