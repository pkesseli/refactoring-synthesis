Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.awt.AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclassâ€‹(Class<?>)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.AWTKeyStroke;

public class MyKeyStroke extends AWTKeyStroke {
    // constructor and other methods here
}

AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass(MyKeyStroke.class);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;

public class MyKeyStroke {
    private final int keyCode;
    private final int modifiers;

    public MyKeyStroke(int keyCode, int modifiers) {
        this.keyCode = keyCode;
        this.modifiers = modifiers;
    }

    public void register() {
        KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager()
            .addKeyEventDispatcher(e -> {
                if (e.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED
                        && e.getKeyCode() == keyCode
                        && e.getModifiers() == modifiers) {
                    // handle the key press event here
                    return true; // consume the event
                }
                return false; // do not consume the event
            });
    }
}

new MyKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER, KeyEvent.CTRL_DOWN_MASK).register();
```

In this refactored code, we create a new `MyKeyStroke` class that represents a key stroke with a specific key code and modifiers. Instead of registering the subclass with `AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass()`, we use `KeyboardFocusManager.addKeyEventDispatcher()` to register a new `KeyEventDispatcher` that listens for key events matching the key code and modifiers of our `MyKeyStroke` instance. When a matching key event is received, we handle it in the `KeyEventDispatcher` and return `true` to consume the event, or `false` to allow it to propagate to other listeners. Finally, we create a new `MyKeyStroke` instance and call its `register()` method to register the key stroke with the `KeyboardFocusManager`.
