I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.event.InputEvent.getModifiers()` to use the recommended method `InputEvent.getModifiersEx()`.

<<< Before refactoring:
```
int modifiers = event.getModifiers();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
int modifiers = event.getModifiersEx();
``` 

This will ensure that the extended modifier keys are used instead of the deprecated method.
