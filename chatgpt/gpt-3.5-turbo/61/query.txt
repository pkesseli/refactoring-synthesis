The method java.awt.event.KeyEvent.getKeyModifiersText​(int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "It is recommended that extended modifier keys and
             InputEvent.getModifiersExText(int) be used instead"
I have a call to this deprecated method in my codebase `this.getKeyModifiersText​(a)`, show me Give me how to refactor my code in the following format:
```
<code before refactoring here>
```
```
<code after refactoring here>
```

Example code should be a straight-line code block. Don't provide extra explanation.
