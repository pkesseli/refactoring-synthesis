Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Graphics graphics = new Graphics();
Rectangle clipRect = graphics.getClipRect();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Graphics graphics = new Graphics();
Rectangle clipBounds = graphics.getClipBounds();
```

Explanation: Instead of using the deprecated `getClipRect()` method, we use the recommended `getClipBounds()` method to get the clipping bounds of the graphics context. We also update the variable name to reflect the change in method name.
