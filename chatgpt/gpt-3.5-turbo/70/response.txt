Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
AffineTransform transform = new AffineTransform();
RenderContext context = new RenderContext(transform);
context.concetenateTransform(new AffineTransform(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0));
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
AffineTransform transform = new AffineTransform();
RenderContext context = new RenderContext(transform);
context.concatenateTransform(new AffineTransform(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0));
``` 

In the original code, the `concetenateTransform` method is called on the `RenderContext` object, which is now deprecated. The refactored code replaces this with the `concatenateTransform` method, which is the recommended replacement.
