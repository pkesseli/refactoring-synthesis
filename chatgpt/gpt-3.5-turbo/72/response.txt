Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated `addItem` method in `java.awt.List`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
List myList = new List();
myList.addItem("Item 1");
myList.addItem("Item 2");
myList.addItem("Item 3");
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
List myList = new List();
myList.add("Item 1");
myList.add("Item 2");
myList.add("Item 3");
```

In the refactored code, we've simply replaced all calls to `addItem` with calls to the recommended replacement method, `add`. This will ensure that our code continues to work as expected, even as the deprecated method is eventually removed from the Java API.
