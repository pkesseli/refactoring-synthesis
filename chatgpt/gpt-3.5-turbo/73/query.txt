The method java.awt.List.addItemâ€‹(String, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by add(String, int)."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
