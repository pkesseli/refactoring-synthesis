Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated `java.awt.List.addItemâ€‹(String, int)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
List myList = new List();
myList.addItem("Item 1", 0);
myList.addItem("Item 2", 1);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
List myList = new List();
myList.add("Item 1", 0);
myList.add("Item 2", 1);
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `addItem` method with the recommended `add` method, which takes the same arguments. This will ensure that our code remains up-to-date with the latest best practices and avoids any potential issues that may arise from using deprecated methods.
