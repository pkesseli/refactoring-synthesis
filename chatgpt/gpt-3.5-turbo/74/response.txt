I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.List.allowsMultipleSelections()` to the recommended method `isMultipleMode()`.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
List myList = new List();
myList.setMultipleMode(true);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
List myList = new List();
myList.isMultipleMode();
``` 

In the above example, we have replaced the deprecated method `allowsMultipleSelections()` with the recommended method `isMultipleMode()`. This will ensure that our code is up-to-date with the latest Java standards and will not cause any issues in the future.
