Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
List myList = new List();
myList.add("item1");
myList.add("item2");
myList.delItem(1);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
List myList = new List();
myList.add("item1");
myList.add("item2");
myList.remove(1);
``` 

In the original code, the `delItem` method is used to remove an item from the `List` object. However, this method is deprecated and should be replaced with the `remove` method. The refactored code replaces the `delItem` method call with a call to `remove`, passing in the index of the item to be removed.
