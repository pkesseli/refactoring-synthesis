The method java.awt.List.delItemsâ€‹(int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 Not for public use in the future.
 This method is expected to be retained only as a package
 private method."
Give me a refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
Example code should be a straight-line code block.
