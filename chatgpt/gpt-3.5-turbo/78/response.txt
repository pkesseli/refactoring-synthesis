Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method java.awt.List.delItemsâ€‹(int, int):

<<< Before refactoring:
```
List myList = new List();
myList.add("Item 1");
myList.add("Item 2");
myList.add("Item 3");
myList.delItems(1, 2);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
List myList = new List();
myList.add("Item 1");
myList.add("Item 2");
myList.add("Item 3");
myList.remove(1);
myList.remove(1);
```

In this refactoring, we've replaced the deprecated delItems method with the remove method, which is not deprecated and achieves the same result. We've also split the original call to delItems into two separate calls to remove, since the delItems method removed multiple items at once, whereas remove only removes one item at a time.
