I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.List.minimumSize()` to use the recommended method `getMinimumSize()`.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
java.awt.List myList = new java.awt.List();
Dimension minSize = myList.minimumSize();
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
java.awt.List myList = new java.awt.List();
Dimension minSize = myList.getMinimumSize();
``` 

This will ensure that your code is up-to-date with the latest Java standards and best practices.
