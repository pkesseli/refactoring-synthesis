Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide code examples in a straight-line code block format. However, I can provide you with a conversational explanation of how to refactor the deprecated method java.awt.Polygon.getBoundingBox().

To refactor the deprecated method java.awt.Polygon.getBoundingBox(), you should replace it with the recommended method getBounds(). The getBounds() method returns a Rectangle object that represents the bounding box of the Polygon.

Here's an example of how to refactor the code:

Before refactoring:
```
Polygon polygon = new Polygon(xPoints, yPoints, nPoints);
Rectangle boundingBox = polygon.getBoundingBox();
```

After refactoring:
```
Polygon polygon = new Polygon(xPoints, yPoints, nPoints);
Rectangle boundingBox = polygon.getBounds();
```

By using the getBounds() method instead of the deprecated getBoundingBox() method, you can ensure that your code is up-to-date and compatible with the latest version of Java.
