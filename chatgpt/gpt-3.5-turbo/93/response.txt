Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method java.awt.Polygon.insideâ€‹(int, int):

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Polygon polygon = new Polygon(new int[]{0, 5, 10}, new int[]{0, 10, 0}, 3);
boolean isInside = polygon.inside(3, 3);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Polygon polygon = new Polygon(new int[]{0, 5, 10}, new int[]{0, 10, 0}, 3);
boolean isInside = polygon.contains(3, 3);
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated method `inside` with the recommended method `contains`. This ensures that our code will continue to work as expected with future versions of Java.
