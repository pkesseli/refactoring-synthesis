Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 50, 50);
if (rect.inside(20, 20)) {
    System.out.println("Point is inside rectangle");
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 50, 50);
if (rect.contains(20, 20)) {
    System.out.println("Point is inside rectangle");
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `inside` method with the recommended `contains` method. This will ensure that our code remains compatible with future versions of Java.
