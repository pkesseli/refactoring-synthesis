Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated `java.awt.Rectangle.move(int, int)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 20, 20);
rect.move(5, 5);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 20, 20);
rect.setLocation(15, 15);
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `move` method with the recommended `setLocation` method. This achieves the same result of moving the rectangle by 5 units in both the x and y directions, but uses the updated API.
