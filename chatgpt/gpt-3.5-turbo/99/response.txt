Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method java.awt.Scrollbar.getLineIncrement():

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Scrollbar scrollbar = new Scrollbar();
int lineIncrement = scrollbar.getLineIncrement();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Scrollbar scrollbar = new Scrollbar();
int lineIncrement = scrollbar.getUnitIncrement();
```

In this refactoring, we've replaced the deprecated method getLineIncrement() with the recommended replacement method getUnitIncrement(). This will ensure that our code remains up-to-date with the latest Java standards and best practices.
