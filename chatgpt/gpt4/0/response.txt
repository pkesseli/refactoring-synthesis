Sorry, as an AI language model, I do not have access to your codebase or development environment, so I cannot provide an executable refactoring example for your specific codebase. However, I can give you some general advice on how to refactor code that uses deprecated methods.

When a method or feature is deprecated, it means that it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. The first step in refactoring code that uses a deprecated method is to look for an alternative method that provides the same functionality.

In the case of the `canAddMethod()` method in the `com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine` class, the deprecation comment suggests that this capability will never be set to true in a JVM TI based JDWP back-end. So, one possible refactoring approach is to check if the current JDWP back-end is JVM TI based and then skip the check for `canAddMethod()`.

Here's an example refactoring approach:

<<< Before refactoring:
// Check if the VirtualMachine supports adding a method
if (virtualMachine.canAddMethod()) {
    // Add a method
    virtualMachine.addMethod(...);
}
// Do other things

>>> After refactoring:
// Check if the VirtualMachine supports adding a method
if (!isJDWPBackendJTVMIBased() && virtualMachine.canAddMethod()) {
    // Add a method
    virtualMachine.addMethod(...);
}
// Do other things

private boolean isJDWPBackendJTVMIBased() {
    // Check if the current JDWP back-end is JVM TI based
    // Return true if it is JVM TI based, false otherwise
}
