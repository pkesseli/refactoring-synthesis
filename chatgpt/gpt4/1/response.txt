As an AI language model, I cannot execute or refactor code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to modify the code to address the deprecation warning. Here's an example:

Before refactoring:
```java
VirtualMachine vm = ... // obtain VirtualMachine instance
if (vm.canUnrestrictedlyRedefineClasses()) {
    // unrestricted class redefinition code here
} else {
    // handle case when class redefinition is not allowed
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
VirtualMachine vm = ... // obtain VirtualMachine instance
try {
    vm.redefineClasses(...); // attempt class redefinition
} catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
    // handle case when class redefinition is not allowed
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the `canUnrestrictedlyRedefineClasses()` check with a `redefineClasses()` call inside a try-catch block. If the `redefineClasses()` call throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`, it means that the JVM does not support unrestricted class redefinition, and we can handle that case accordingly.
