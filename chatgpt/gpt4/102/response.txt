Sure, here's an example of how to refactor a call to `setLineIncrement` in Java code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Scrollbar;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scrollbar scrollbar = new Scrollbar();
        scrollbar.setLineIncrement(10);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Scrollbar;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scrollbar scrollbar = new Scrollbar();
        scrollbar.setUnitIncrement(10);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `setLineIncrement` method with the recommended `setUnitIncrement` method, which serves the same purpose but has a clearer name. This should help make the code more readable and maintainable, and also avoid potential issues with using deprecated functionality.
