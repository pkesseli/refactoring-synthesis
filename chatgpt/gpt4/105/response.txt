Sure, here's an example refactoring for using the non-deprecated `append()` method in Java's `TextArea` class:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.TextArea;

public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextArea myTextArea = new TextArea();
        myTextArea.appendText("This is some text to append");
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.TextArea;

public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextArea myTextArea = new TextArea();
        myTextArea.append("This is some text to append");
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the deprecated `appendText()` method has been replaced with the non-deprecated `append()` method. This change ensures that the code will continue to work properly and be compatible with newer versions of Java, which may eventually remove the deprecated method altogether.
