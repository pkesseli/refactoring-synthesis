I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase and can't provide a specific executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.TextArea.insertText(String, int)` method.

Here is an example of how you could refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
java.awt.TextArea textArea = new java.awt.TextArea();
textArea.insertText("Hello, world!", 0);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
java.awt.TextArea textArea = new java.awt.TextArea();
textArea.insert("Hello, world!", 0);
```

In this example, the deprecated `insertText` method is replaced with the `insert` method, which has the same functionality but is not deprecated. This will allow your code to continue to function correctly and avoid any potential issues that may arise from using deprecated methods.
