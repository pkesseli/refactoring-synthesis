Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example as I do not have access to an integrated development environment (IDE) or a codebase to work with. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.TextArea.minimumSize()` to the recommended method `java.awt.Component.getMinimumSize()`.

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyTextArea extends TextArea {
    
    @Override
    public Dimension minimumSize() {
        return new Dimension(100, 100);
    }
    
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyTextArea extends TextArea {
    
    @Override
    public Dimension getMinimumSize() {
        return new Dimension(100, 100);
    }
    
}
```

In the above example, the deprecated method `minimumSize()` is replaced with the recommended method `getMinimumSize()`. The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that the method is intended to override a method in the superclass, and the implementation of the method returns a `Dimension` object with a width and height of 100 pixels.
