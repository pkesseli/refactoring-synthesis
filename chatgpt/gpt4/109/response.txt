Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase, so I can't provide you with a specific example. However, I can explain how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `preferredSize()` method in Java AWT's `TextArea` class.

Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.*;

public class MyTextArea extends TextArea {
    
    public MyTextArea(int rows, int columns) {
        super(rows, columns);
        setSize(preferredSize()); // Deprecated method
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.*;

public class MyTextArea extends TextArea {
    
    public MyTextArea(int rows, int columns) {
        super(rows, columns);
        setSize(getPreferredSize()); // Replaced with getPreferredSize() method
    }
}
```

In the `MyTextArea` class, we changed the `setSize(preferredSize())` method call to `setSize(getPreferredSize())`. This is the recommended way to get the preferred size of a component and set its size accordingly, as `preferredSize()` is now deprecated.
