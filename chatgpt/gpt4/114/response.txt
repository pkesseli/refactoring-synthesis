Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase and environment to provide an executable refactoring example. However, here is an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.TextField.preferredSize()` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.TextField;

public class TextFieldExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        System.out.println(textField.preferredSize());
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.TextField;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class TextFieldExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        System.out.println(textField.getPreferredSize());
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `preferredSize()` method with the `getPreferredSize()` method. This will ensure that the code remains compatible with the latest versions of the JDK.
