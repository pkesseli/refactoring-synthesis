Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example for a specific codebase without access to it. However, I can provide general guidance on how to refactor code that uses deprecated methods:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.TextField;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        textField.setEchoCharacter('*');
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.TextField;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        textField.setEchoChar('*');
    }
}
```

In this case, the `setEchoCharacter(char)` method has been deprecated and replaced by `setEchoChar(char)`. Therefore, the code has been refactored to use the new method instead of the deprecated one.
