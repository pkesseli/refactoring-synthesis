Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example for you. However, I can give you a general idea of how to refactor your code.

Before refactoring: 

```
myWindow.applyResourceBundle("myResourceBundle.properties");
```

After refactoring:

```
myWindow.applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(Locale.getDefault()));
```

In the refactored code, we are using the `applyComponentOrientation` method instead of the deprecated `applyResourceBundle` method. We are also getting the default component orientation based on the default locale using the `ComponentOrientation.getOrientation` method.
