Unfortunately, as a language model, I cannot provide executable examples. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor code to replace the deprecated `java.awt.Window.applyResourceBundle(ResourceBundle)` method with `Component.applyComponentOrientation()`.

Assuming you have an instance of `Window` called `myWindow` and a `ResourceBundle` called `myResourceBundle`, here is an example of the refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:

```
myWindow.applyResourceBundle(myResourceBundle);
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
myWindow.applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(myResourceBundle.getLocale()));
```

In the refactored code, the `applyResourceBundle()` method has been replaced with `applyComponentOrientation()`. This method takes a `ComponentOrientation` object as its parameter, which is obtained by calling `ComponentOrientation.getOrientation()` and passing in the locale obtained from the `ResourceBundle`.
