Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Window.hide()` to the recommended method `java.awt.Window.setVisible(false)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Window myWindow = new Window();
myWindow.hide();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Window myWindow = new Window();
myWindow.setVisible(false);
```

In the refactored code, the `hide()` method has been replaced with the `setVisible(false)` method, which achieves the same result of hiding the window.
