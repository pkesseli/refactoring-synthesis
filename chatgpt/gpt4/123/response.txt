Sure, here's an example refactoring for replacing the deprecated `java.awt.Window.postEvent(Event)` method with the recommended `dispatchEvent(AWTEvent)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
// Create a new window object
Window window = new Window(parent);

// Create a new event object
Event event = new Event(window, Event.WINDOW_CLOSING);

// Post the event to the window
window.postEvent(event);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
// Create a new window object
Window window = new Window(parent);

// Create a new event object
Event event = new Event(window, Event.WINDOW_CLOSING);

// Dispatch the event to the window
window.dispatchEvent(event);
```

In this example, the `postEvent()` method has been replaced with the recommended `dispatchEvent()` method. This will ensure that the code remains compatible with future versions of Java, and helps to avoid any potential issues that may arise from using deprecated methods.
