The method java.io.DataInputStream.readLine() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not properly convert bytes to characters.
 As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to read lines of text is via the
 BufferedReader.readLine() method.  Programs that use the
 DataInputStream class to read lines can be converted to use
 the BufferedReader class by replacing code of the form:
      DataInputStream d = new DataInputStream(in);
 
 with:
      BufferedReader d
          = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));

Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
