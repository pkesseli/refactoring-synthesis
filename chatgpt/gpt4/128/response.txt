Assuming that we have an InputStream object named `inputStream` and we want to read lines from it, here's an example of how we can refactor the deprecated `DataInputStream.readLine()` method to use `BufferedReader.readLine()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
String line = dataInputStream.readLine();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
String line = bufferedReader.readLine();
```

By using `BufferedReader` and `InputStreamReader` instead of `DataInputStream`, we can safely and efficiently read lines of text from the input stream.
