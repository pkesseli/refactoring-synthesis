The method java.io.File.toURL() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not automatically escape characters that
 are illegal in URLs.  It is recommended that new code convert an
 abstract pathname into a URL by first converting it into a URI, via the
 toURI method, and then converting the URI into a URL
 via the URI.toURL method."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
