Before refactoring:
```
File file = new File("path/to/file");
URL url = file.toURL();
```

After refactoring:
```
File file = new File("path/to/file");
URI uri = file.toURI();
URL url = uri.toURL();
``` 

Explanation:
The `toURL()` method is deprecated because it does not handle characters that are illegal in URLs. The recommended way to convert a file path to a URL is to first convert it to a URI using the `toURI()` method, and then convert the URI to a URL using the `toURL()` method. Therefore, the refactored code first creates a `File` object for the file path, then converts it to a `URI` using the `toURI()` method, and finally converts the `URI` to a `URL` using the `toURL()` method. This will properly handle any illegal characters in the file path.
