The method java.awt.Component.actionâ€‹(Event, Object) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 should register this component as ActionListener on component
 which fires action events."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
