The method java.io.ObjectInputStream.readLine() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not properly convert bytes to characters.
          see DataInputStream for the details and alternatives."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
