<<< Before refactoring:
```
try {
    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream);
    String line = ois.readLine();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle exception
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
try {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    String line = br.readLine();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle exception
}
``` 

Explanation:
The `ObjectInputStream.readLine()` method is deprecated because it doesn't properly convert bytes to characters. Instead, we should use a `BufferedReader` with an `InputStreamReader` to read the characters from the input stream. The `InputStreamReader` constructor allows us to specify the character encoding to be used, which in this case is `UTF-8`. We can then use the `readLine()` method of the `BufferedReader` to read a line of text from the input stream.
