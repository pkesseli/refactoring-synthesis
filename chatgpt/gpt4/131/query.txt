The method java.io.ObjectOutputStream.PutField.writeâ€‹(ObjectOutput) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not write the values contained by this
         PutField object in a proper format, and may
         result in corruption of the serialization stream.  The
         correct way to write PutField data is by
         calling the ObjectOutputStream.writeFields()
         method."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
