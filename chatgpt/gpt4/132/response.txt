Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `isJavaLetter` method to use the recommended `isJavaIdentifierStart` method instead:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public static boolean isLetter(char c) {
    return Character.isJavaLetter(c);
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public static boolean isLetter(char c) {
    return Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(c);
}
```

In this example, the `isLetter` method originally called `Character.isJavaLetter` to determine if a given character was a Java letter. After refactoring, the method instead calls `Character.isJavaIdentifierStart` which is the recommended replacement for the deprecated method.
