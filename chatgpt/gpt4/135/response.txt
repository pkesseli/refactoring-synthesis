Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase to provide a specific example for refactoring. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to apply the suggested change to replace the usage of the deprecated method `newInstance()` with the alternative method `getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()` in Java:

Before refactoring:

```
Class<MyClass> clazz = MyClass.class;
MyClass obj = clazz.newInstance();
```

After refactoring:

```
Class<MyClass> clazz = MyClass.class;
MyClass obj = clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
``` 

Note that in the refactored code, we are using `getDeclaredConstructor()` to obtain a constructor object for the class, and then invoking `newInstance()` on the constructor object to create a new instance of the class. This approach avoids the use of the deprecated method `newInstance()` and also provides a way to catch checked exceptions like `InvocationTargetException` and `NoSuchMethodException`.
