Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example as I do not have the context or code that needs to be refactored. However, I can give you a general idea of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `java.lang.ClassLoader.getPackage(String)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
Package pkg = classLoader.getPackage("com.example.package");
if (pkg != null) {
  // do something with the package
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
Package pkg = null;
try {
  pkg = classLoader.loadClass("com.example.package.SomeClass").getPackage();
} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
  // handle the exception
}
if (pkg != null) {
  // do something with the package
}
```

In the refactored code, instead of using `getPackage()` method, we use `loadClass()` method to load a class from the package, and then call `getPackage()` on that class to get the package object. This approach ensures that the package is loaded from the correct class loader, and avoids any issues related to multiple class loaders delegating to each other.
