The method java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.hasPrivateAccess() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method was originally designed to test PRIVATE access
 that implies full privilege access but MODULE access has since become
 independent of PRIVATE access.  It is recommended to call
 MethodHandles.Lookup.hasFullPrivilegeAccess() instead."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
