Before refactoring:
```
public class MyClass {
   // Some fields and methods...
  
   @Override
   protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
      try {
         // Cleanup code for non-heap resources...
      } finally {
         super.finalize();
      }
   }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
public class MyClass implements AutoCloseable {
   private SomeResource resource;
  
   public MyClass() {
      resource = new SomeResource();
   }
  
   // Some methods...
  
   @Override
   public void close() throws Exception {
      // Release the resource...
      resource.close();
   }
}
```
In this refactoring example, the `finalize()` method in `MyClass` is replaced with the `AutoCloseable` interface. The non-heap resource held by the class is now managed by an instance of `SomeResource` which implements the `Closeable` interface. The cleanup code for the resource is moved to the `close()` method, which will be called explicitly by the client code when it's done with the instance of `MyClass`. This approach is more reliable and efficient than relying on the finalization mechanism.
