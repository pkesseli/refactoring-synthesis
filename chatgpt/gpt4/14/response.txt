I apologize, but as a language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.bounds()` method to use the recommended `getBounds()` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
Component comp = new Component();
Rectangle bounds = comp.bounds();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
Component comp = new Component();
Rectangle bounds = comp.getBounds();
``` 

In the above example, the `bounds()` method has been replaced with the recommended `getBounds()` method to retrieve the bounding rectangle of the component. This should eliminate the deprecation warning and ensure that the code works correctly with newer versions of Java.
