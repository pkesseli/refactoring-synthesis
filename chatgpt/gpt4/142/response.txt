Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide executable examples. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `Proxy.getProxyClass` method to use the recommended `Proxy.newProxyInstance` method.

Before refactoring:
```java
Class<?> proxyClass = Proxy.getProxyClass(classLoader, interfaces);
Constructor<?> constructor = proxyClass.getConstructor(InvocationHandler.class);
return (SomeInterface) constructor.newInstance(handler);
```

After refactoring:
```java
return (SomeInterface) Proxy.newProxyInstance(classLoader, interfaces, handler);
```

This code creates a new proxy instance using the `Proxy.newProxyInstance` method, which takes in the class loader, interfaces, and invocation handler to generate the proxy instance. This avoids the use of the deprecated `Proxy.getProxyClass` method and ensures that the generated proxy class is accessible outside of its module.
