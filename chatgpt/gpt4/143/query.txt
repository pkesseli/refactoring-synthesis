The method java.lang.Runtime.Version.major() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JavaÂ SE 10, the first element of a version
 number is not the major-release number but the feature-release
 counter, incremented for every time-based release.  Use the Runtime.Version.feature() method in preference to this method.  For compatibility,
 this method returns the value of the feature
 element."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
