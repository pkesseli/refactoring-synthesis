The method java.lang.Runtime.Version.minor() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JavaÂ SE 10, the second element of a version
 number is not the minor-release number but the interim-release
 counter, incremented for every interim release.  Use the Runtime.Version.interim() method in preference to this method.  For compatibility,
 this method returns the value of the interim
 element, or zero if it is absent."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
