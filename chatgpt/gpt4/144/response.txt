Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.lang.Runtime.Version.minor()` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
int minorVersion = Runtime.version().minor();
System.out.println("Java minor version: " + minorVersion);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
int interimVersion = Runtime.version().interim();
System.out.println("Java interim version: " + interimVersion);
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the use of `minor()` with `interim()`, which is the recommended method as per the deprecation comment. The code now correctly prints the interim release number instead of the deprecated minor release number.
