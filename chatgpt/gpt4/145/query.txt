The method java.lang.Runtime.Version.security() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JavaÂ SE 10, the third element of a version
 number is not the security level but the update-release counter,
 incremented for every update release.  Use the Runtime.Version.update()
 method in preference to this method.  For compatibility, this method
 returns the value of the update element, or
 zero if it is absent."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
