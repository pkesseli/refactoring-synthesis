Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `checkMulticast` method in `SecurityManager`:

<<< Before refactoring:

```
SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
if (sm != null) {
    try {
        InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
        sm.checkMulticast(group, (byte) 0);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // handle exception
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
if (sm != null) {
    try {
        Permission perm = new SocketPermission("224.0.0.1", "accept");
        sm.checkPermission(perm);
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        // handle exception
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the call to `checkMulticast` with a call to `checkPermission` using a `SocketPermission` object. The `SocketPermission` constructor takes two arguments: the host and the action. In this case, the host is the multicast address we want to check, and the action is `"accept"` to indicate that we want to check if the application has permission to receive multicast packets on this address. If the `checkPermission` call throws a `SecurityException`, it means that the application does not have the required permission.
