Before refactoring:
```
String str = "Hello World";
byte[] byteArray = new byte[str.length()];
str.getBytes(0, str.length(), byteArray, 0);
```

After refactoring:
```
String str = "Hello World";
byte[] byteArray = str.getBytes();
``` 

Explanation: 
The `String.getBytes(int, int, byte[], int)` method is deprecated because it doesn't properly convert characters into bytes, and can lead to unexpected results when used with non-default character sets. As a result, the preferred way to convert a string to bytes is to use the `String.getBytes()` method, which uses the platform's default charset. 

In the refactored code, we replace the deprecated method with the preferred method `String.getBytes()`, which converts the string to bytes using the platform's default charset. This simplifies the code and avoids potential issues with character set conversions.
