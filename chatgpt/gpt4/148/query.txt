The method java.lang.Thread.countStackFrames() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method was originally designed to count the number of
             stack frames but the results were never well-defined and it
             depended on thread-suspension.
             This method is subject to removal in a future version of Java SE."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
