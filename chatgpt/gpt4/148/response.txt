Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.lang.Thread.countStackFrames()` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
Thread thread = Thread.currentThread();
int stackFramesCount = thread.countStackFrames();
System.out.println("Number of stack frames: " + stackFramesCount);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
StackTraceElement[] stackTrace = Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();
int stackFramesCount = stackTrace.length;
System.out.println("Number of stack frames: " + stackFramesCount);
```

In the refactored code, we use the `Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace()` method to retrieve an array of `StackTraceElement` objects representing the current thread's stack trace. Then, we simply get the length of the array to count the number of stack frames. This code should work just as well as the deprecated method, and it will continue to work in future versions of Java SE.
