Sure, here's an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `Thread.resume()` method:

<<< Before refactoring:

```
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.suspend();
// Do some other work...
thread.resume();
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.suspend();
// Do some other work...
Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
```

In the refactored code, we replace the call to `Thread.resume()` with a call to `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`. This interrupts the current thread, which will cause any call to `Thread.suspend()` to throw an `InterruptedException`. By using this method, we can safely replace calls to `Thread.resume()` without risking deadlock.
