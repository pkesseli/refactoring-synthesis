Sure! Here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Button myButton = new Button("Click me");
Event myEvent = new Event(myButton, Event.ACTION_EVENT, null);
myButton.deliverEvent(myEvent);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Button myButton = new Button("Click me");
Event myEvent = new Event(myButton, Event.ACTION_EVENT, null);
myButton.dispatchEvent(myEvent);
```

Explanation: The code before the refactoring uses the deprecated `deliverEvent()` method to send an `Event` to a `Button` component. The code after the refactoring replaces the use of `deliverEvent()` with the recommended method `dispatchEvent()`, which provides the same functionality.
