The method java.lang.ThreadGroup.allowThreadSuspensionâ€‹(boolean) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The definition of this call depends on ThreadGroup.suspend(),
             which is deprecated.  Further, the behavior of this call
             was never specified."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
