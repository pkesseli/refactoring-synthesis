As an AI language model, I cannot execute code, but I can provide an example of refactoring that addresses the deprecation warning of the `java.lang.ThreadGroup.allowThreadSuspension(boolean)` method.

<<< Before refactoring:
```
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
threadGroup.allowThreadSuspension(true);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
// setDaemon method is used to set the thread group to be a daemon thread group
threadGroup.setDaemon(true);
``` 

In the refactored code, instead of using the `allowThreadSuspension()` method, we set the thread group to be a daemon thread group using the `setDaemon()` method. This avoids using the deprecated method and eliminates any potential undefined behavior caused by it.
