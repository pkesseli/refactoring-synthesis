As an AI language model, I cannot execute code. However, I can provide you with a refactoring example for the deprecated method `java.lang.ThreadGroup.resume()` in Java:

Before refactoring:
```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("exampleGroup");
Thread thread = new Thread(group, () -> {
    // Do some work
});

// Suspend the thread group
group.suspend();
// ...
// Resume the thread group
group.resume();
```

After refactoring:
```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("exampleGroup");
Thread thread = new Thread(group, () -> {
    // Do some work
});

// Suspend the thread group
group.suspend();
// ...
// Interrupt all threads in the thread group to resume them
group.interrupt();
``` 

In the refactored code, instead of using the deprecated method `ThreadGroup.resume()`, we interrupt all the threads in the thread group to resume them. This is a safer and more reliable approach, as it avoids the deadlock-prone behavior associated with using `ThreadGroup.resume()`.
