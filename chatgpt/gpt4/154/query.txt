The method java.lang.ThreadGroup.stop() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is inherently unsafe.  See
     Thread.stop() for details."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
