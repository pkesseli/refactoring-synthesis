Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot create executable code. However, I can suggest a possible refactoring example that can help you address the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
// ... some code ...
threadGroup.stop();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
// ... some code ...
Thread[] threads = new Thread[threadGroup.activeCount()];
threadGroup.enumerate(threads);
for (Thread thread : threads) {
   thread.interrupt();
}
```

In the refactored code, the `ThreadGroup.stop()` method has been replaced with a safer approach that uses `Thread.interrupt()` to stop the threads in the group. This approach allows the threads to gracefully terminate by handling the `InterruptedException` and cleaning up any resources before exiting.
