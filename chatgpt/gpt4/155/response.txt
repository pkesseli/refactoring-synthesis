Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to provide executable code examples. However, I can provide you with a refactoring suggestion for the deprecated method `java.lang.ThreadGroup.suspend()`.

Before refactoring:

```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("exampleGroup");
Thread thread = new Thread(group, new ExampleRunnable());
thread.start();
group.suspend();
```

After refactoring:

```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("exampleGroup");
Thread thread = new Thread(group, new ExampleRunnable());
thread.start();
Thread.currentThread().suspend();
```

In the refactored code, the `suspend()` method of the `ThreadGroup` class is replaced with the `suspend()` method of the `Thread` class. This is done because the `ThreadGroup.suspend()` method is deprecated and considered to be inherently deadlock-prone. To avoid this issue, we can use the `Thread.currentThread().suspend()` method instead, which is safer and less prone to deadlocks.
