I apologize, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase and environment to perform refactoring actions directly. However, I can provide you an example of how you can refactor your code to replace the deprecated `disable()` method with the recommended `setEnabled(false)` method in Java:

Before refactoring:

```
button.disable();
```

After refactoring:

```
button.setEnabled(false);
```

In this refactored code, the `setEnabled(false)` method is used instead of the deprecated `disable()` method to disable the button.
