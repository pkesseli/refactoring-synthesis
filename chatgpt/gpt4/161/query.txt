The method java.net.MulticastSocket.getInterface() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The network interface may not be uniquely identified by
             the InetAddress returned.
             Use MulticastSocket.getNetworkInterface() instead."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
