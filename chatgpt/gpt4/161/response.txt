I'm sorry, but as a language model, I do not have the capability to execute code. However, I can provide you with an example refactoring in the requested format. 

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(port);
socket.setInterface(networkInterface);
```
>>> After refactoring:
```
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(port);
socket.setNetworkInterface(networkInterface);
``` 
In this example, the deprecated method `getInterface()` is replaced with the non-deprecated method `getNetworkInterface()` for setting the network interface of a `MulticastSocket` object.
