The method java.net.MulticastSocket.getTTL() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "use the getTimeToLive method instead, which returns
 an int instead of a byte."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
