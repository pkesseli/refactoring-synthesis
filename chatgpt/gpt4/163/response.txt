Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with a code snippet that demonstrates the refactoring from using the deprecated `getTTL()` method to using the recommended `getTimeToLive()` method:

Before refactoring:
```java
MulticastSocket multicastSocket = new MulticastSocket();
byte ttl = multicastSocket.getTTL();
System.out.println("TTL value: " + ttl);
```

After refactoring:
```java
MulticastSocket multicastSocket = new MulticastSocket();
int ttl = multicastSocket.getTimeToLive();
System.out.println("TTL value: " + ttl);
```

As you can see, the only change required is to replace the `getTTL()` method with the `getTimeToLive()` method and change the variable type from `byte` to `int`.
