The method java.net.MulticastSocket.joinGroupâ€‹(InetAddress) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not accept the network interface on
             which to join the multicast group. Use
             MulticastSocket.joinGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface) instead."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
