Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated `joinGroup(InetAddress)` method in `MulticastSocket` to use `joinGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface)` instead:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
try {
    InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
    MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(4446);
    socket.joinGroup(group);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
try {
    InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
    NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByName("eth0");
    InetSocketAddress socketAddress = new InetSocketAddress(group, 4446);
    MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(null);
    socket.joinGroup(socketAddress, networkInterface);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this refactored code, we've created an `InetSocketAddress` object with the multicast group address and port number. We've also obtained a `NetworkInterface` object for the desired network interface. Finally, we've used the `joinGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface)` method to join the multicast group on the specified interface.
