The method java.net.MulticastSocket.sendâ€‹(DatagramPacket, byte) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use the following code or its equivalent instead:
  ......
  int ttl = mcastSocket.getTimeToLive();
  mcastSocket.setTimeToLive(newttl);
  mcastSocket.send(p);
  mcastSocket.setTimeToLive(ttl);
  ......"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
