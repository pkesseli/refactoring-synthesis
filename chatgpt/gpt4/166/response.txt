Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `MulticastSocket.send` method in Java:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
byte[] data = "Hello, world!".getBytes();
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("230.0.0.1");
int port = 4446;

DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(data, data.length, group, port);
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();

socket.send(packet, (byte) 1);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
byte[] data = "Hello, world!".getBytes();
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("230.0.0.1");
int port = 4446;

DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(data, data.length, group, port);
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();

int ttl = socket.getTimeToLive();
socket.setTimeToLive((byte) 1);
socket.send(packet);
socket.setTimeToLive(ttl);
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the `send` method with the recommended code snippet provided in the deprecation comment. We first store the current TTL value of the multicast socket, set the TTL value to the desired value (in this case, 1), send the packet, and then restore the original TTL value. This way, we ensure that the TTL value of the socket is not permanently changed by the `send` operation.
