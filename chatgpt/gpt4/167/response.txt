Sure, here's an example refactoring to replace the deprecated `java.net.MulticastSocket.setInterfaceâ€‹(InetAddress)` method with the recommended `MulticastSocket.setNetworkInterface(NetworkInterface)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(4446);
socket.setInterface(group);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(4446);
NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(group);
socket.setNetworkInterface(networkInterface);
```

In this refactoring, we first get the `InetAddress` for the multicast group we want to use. Then, instead of calling the deprecated `setInterface()` method on the `MulticastSocket` object, we use the `getByInetAddress()` method on `NetworkInterface` to get the `NetworkInterface` object that corresponds to the network interface associated with the `InetAddress`. Finally, we call the `setNetworkInterface()` method on the `MulticastSocket` object and pass in the `NetworkInterface` object to set the desired network interface for the socket.
