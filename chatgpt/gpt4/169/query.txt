The method java.net.MulticastSocket.setTTLâ€‹(byte) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "use the setTimeToLive method instead, which uses
             int instead of byte as the type for ttl."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
