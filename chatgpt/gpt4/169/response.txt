Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
byte ttl = 2;
socket.setTTL(ttl);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
int ttl = 2;
socket.setTimeToLive(ttl);
``` 

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `setTTL(byte)` method with the recommended `setTimeToLive(int)` method, which uses an `int` instead of a `byte` for the `ttl` parameter. This ensures that the code is up to date with current best practices and avoids any potential issues that might arise from using deprecated code.
