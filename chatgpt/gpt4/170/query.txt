The method java.net.URLConnection.getDefaultRequestPropertyâ€‹(String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The instance specific getRequestProperty method
 should be used after an appropriate instance of URLConnection
 is obtained."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
