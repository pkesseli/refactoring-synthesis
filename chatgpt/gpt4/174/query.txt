The method java.net.URLStreamHandler.setURLâ€‹(URL, String, String, int, String, String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use setURL(URL, String, String, int, String, String, String,
             String);"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
