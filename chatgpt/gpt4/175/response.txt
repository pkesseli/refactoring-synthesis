I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example without further context. 

Can you please provide more details on what you want to achieve with the refactoring example? What is the goal of the refactoring and what is the context of the code where the `java.rmi.dgc.VMID.isUnique()` method is being used? 

Once I have a better understanding of your requirements, I can provide you with a refactoring example.
