The method java.rmi.registry.RegistryHandler.registryStubâ€‹(String, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "no replacement.  As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, RMI no
 longer uses the RegistryHandler to obtain the registry's
 stub."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
