I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase, so I can't provide an exact refactoring example without seeing the codebase. However, I can provide you with general guidelines on how to refactor the code that uses the deprecated method java.rmi.server.LogStream.getDefaultStream().

Before refactoring: 

```java
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        LogStream stream = LogStream.getDefaultStream();
        stream.println("This is a log message.");
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyClass {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());

    public void myMethod() {
        LOGGER.info("This is a log message.");
    }
}
```

Explanation:
Since the method `java.rmi.server.LogStream.getDefaultStream()` is deprecated, it's better to use another logging framework like `java.util.logging.Logger`. In the refactored code, we created a static final logger field using `Logger.getLogger()` method, which is recommended to use instead of `LogStream.getDefaultStream()`. The logger can then be used to log messages using its various logging methods, in this case, `logger.info()` method.
