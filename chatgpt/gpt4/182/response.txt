Sorry, but as a language model, I do not have access to your existing code base or development environment to provide a refactoring example. However, I can suggest some alternatives that you can consider for the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.LogStream.getOutputStream()`.

Instead of using the deprecated method, you can consider using one of the following alternatives:

1. `java.util.logging.Logger`: This is a widely used logging framework in Java. You can create an instance of `Logger` and use its methods such as `log`, `fine`, and `severe` to log messages to a file or a console. Here's an example:

```
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyApp");
logger.log(Level.INFO, "This is an info message");
```

2. `java.io.PrintWriter`: This is a class that provides methods to write formatted text to a character stream. You can create an instance of `PrintWriter` and use its `println` method to write messages to a file or a console. Here's an example:

```
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter("log.txt");
writer.println("This is a message");
```

These alternatives should help you refactor your code and replace the deprecated method with a suitable alternative.
