I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to your codebase or development environment to provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to refactor your code.

Since the method `java.rmi.server.LogStream.parseLevel(String)` is deprecated with no replacement, you should consider using an alternative approach for logging. One possible solution is to use the `java.util.logging` API, which provides a standard logging framework in Java.

Here is an example of how you could modify your code to use `java.util.logging` instead of `java.rmi.server.LogStream.parseLevel(String)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
String logLevelString = "INFO";
int logLevelInt = LogStream.parseLevel(logLevelString);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
String logLevelString = "INFO";
Level logLevel = Level.parse(logLevelString);
int logLevelInt = logLevel.intValue();
```

In this example, we use the `Level.parse()` method to convert the log level string to a `Level` object, and then use the `intValue()` method to get the integer value of the log level. You can customize the logging configuration by creating a `logging.properties` file and passing it as a system property when you start your application.
