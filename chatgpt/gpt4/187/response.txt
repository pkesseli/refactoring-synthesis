I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot access or modify the code. However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to refactor the code. 

Since the `java.rmi.server.LogStream.toString()` method is deprecated and there is no replacement for it, you can simply remove the usage of this method in your code. If you need to log messages, you can use a logging framework such as Log4j or java.util.logging.

Here is an example of how you can use java.util.logging instead of `java.rmi.server.LogStream.toString()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LogStream logStream = LogStream.log("myLog");
        System.out.println(logStream.toString());
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyClass {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LOGGER.info("This is a log message");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have replaced the usage of `java.rmi.server.LogStream.toString()` with `java.util.logging.Logger`. We have created a static final LOGGER instance of the Logger class and used the `info()` method to log messages.
