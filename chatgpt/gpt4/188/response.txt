I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase, so I can't provide you with an executable refactoring example for your specific code. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(byte[], int, int) based on the Javadoc deprecation comment.

The deprecation comment "no replacement" indicates that there is no direct replacement for the deprecated method. In this case, you have two options:

1. Ignore the deprecation warning and continue using the deprecated method. However, this is not recommended as the deprecated method may be removed in future versions of Java and may cause compatibility issues.

2. Rewrite the code to use a different logging mechanism that does not rely on the deprecated method. This may require a significant refactor of your codebase, depending on how extensively the deprecated method is used.

Here's a general refactoring example that shows how you could replace the deprecated method with a more modern logging mechanism:

<<< Before refactoring:
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyClass {
  public void myMethod() {
    LogStream logStream = LogStream.log("myLog");
    byte[] data = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 };
    logStream.write(data, 0, data.length);
  }
}
>>> After refactoring:
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyClass {
  private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("myLog");

  public void myMethod() {
    byte[] data = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 };
    logger.info("Data: " + Arrays.toString(data));
  }
}

In this example, we've replaced the LogStream.write method with a call to the java.util.logging.Logger.info method. The Logger class provides a more modern and flexible logging mechanism that is widely used in Java applications. We've also refactored the code to use a static Logger instance instead of creating a new LogStream instance for each method call.
