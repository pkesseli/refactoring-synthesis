Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide executable code examples. However, here's a refactoring example that demonstrates how to replace the deprecated method `java.awt.Component.gotFocus(Event, Object)` with the recommended method `processFocusEvent(FocusEvent)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    //...
    public void gotFocus(Event evt, Object obj) {
        // Handle focus event here
    }
    //...
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    //...
    @Override
    protected void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent evt) {
        super.processFocusEvent(evt);
        // Handle focus event here
    }
    //...
}
```

In this refactoring example, the `gotFocus(Event, Object)` method in the `MyComponent` class has been replaced with the `processFocusEvent(FocusEvent)` method. The `@Override` annotation is added to indicate that this method is overriding a superclass method. The superclass implementation is called using `super.processFocusEvent(evt)` before handling the focus event logic in the subclass. This refactor ensures that the code is up-to-date with the recommended approach for handling focus events in Java.
