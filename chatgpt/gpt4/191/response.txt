I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am unable to perform actual code refactoring on your local environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to update your code to address the deprecated method.

Before refactoring:

```
public String myMethod() {
    Operation op = // instantiate Operation object
    return op.toString();
}
```

After refactoring:

```
public String myMethod() {
    Operation op = // instantiate Operation object
    return "Operation: " + op.getClass().getName();
}
```

In the example above, we replace the call to the deprecated `toString()` method with a custom implementation that returns a string containing the name of the `Operation` object's class. This provides a similar functionality to the original method without relying on the deprecated API.
