I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot modify or execute code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to handle the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.done()`.

Before refactoring:

```
public class MyRemoteObject implements Remote {
    // other implementation details
    
    @Override
    public void doSomething() throws RemoteException {
        // implementation details
        
        // deprecated method
        remoteCall.done();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
public class MyRemoteObject implements Remote {
    // other implementation details
    
    @Override
    public void doSomething() throws RemoteException {
        // implementation details
        
        // alternative method
        remoteCall.releaseOutputStream();
        remoteCall.releaseInputStream();
    }
}
```

Instead of using the deprecated `done()` method, the `releaseOutputStream()` and `releaseInputStream()` methods can be used to clean up the resources associated with the remote call. The `releaseOutputStream()` method releases the output stream associated with the remote call, and the `releaseInputStream()` method releases the input stream.
