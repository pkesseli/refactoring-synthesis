I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I am unable to refactor code in an executable way. However, I can suggest some possible ways to address the deprecation warning.

One possible way to address the deprecation warning for the `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.getInputStream()` method is to replace it with an alternative implementation that achieves the same functionality. Since the deprecation comment mentions that there is no replacement for this method, it may require refactoring the code that uses this method.

Here's an example of how you might refactor the code that uses `RemoteCall.getInputStream()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...
InputStream inputStream = remoteCall.getInputStream();
// use inputStream to read data from the remote call
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...
ObjectInput objectInput = remoteCall.getInputStream();
InputStream inputStream = new ObjectInputStream(objectInput);
// use inputStream to read data from the remote call
```

In this refactored code, we first get the `ObjectInput` instance using the deprecated `getInputStream()` method, which still works. Then, we wrap the `ObjectInput` instance with an `ObjectInputStream` to get the `InputStream` instance that can be used to read data from the remote call.
