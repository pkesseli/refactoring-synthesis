I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot execute code. However, I can provide you with an example refactoring suggestion for the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.getOutputStream()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
// Some code that uses RemoteCall.getOutputStream()
RemoteCall call = ...;
OutputStream out = call.getOutputStream();
// Use the output stream...
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
// Refactored code that avoids using RemoteCall.getOutputStream()
RemoteCall call = ...;
// Obtain a remote reference to the server object that implements the RemoteCall interface
MyRemoteObject obj = (MyRemoteObject) Naming.lookup("rmi://localhost:1099/MyRemoteObject");
// Use the server object's method to get an output stream
OutputStream out = obj.getOutputStream(call);
// Use the output stream...
```

Note that this is just an example refactoring and may not be suitable for all scenarios. It's important to carefully consider the implications of any refactoring before implementing it in production code.
