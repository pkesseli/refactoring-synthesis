I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your existing codebase, so I can't provide a specific example of how to refactor the deprecated method java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.releaseInputStream() in your code. However, here's a general example of how you might refactor this code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = // get remote call object
InputStream inputStream = remoteCall.getInputStream();

// use the input stream
...

remoteCall.releaseInputStream(inputStream);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
RemoteCall remoteCall = // get remote call object
InputStream inputStream = remoteCall.getInputStream();

try {
  // use the input stream
  ...
}
finally {
  try {
    inputStream.close();
  }
  catch (IOException ex) {
    // handle exception
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, instead of using the deprecated releaseInputStream() method to release the input stream after using it, we manually close the input stream using a try-finally block. This ensures that the input stream is properly closed regardless of whether an exception is thrown while using it.
