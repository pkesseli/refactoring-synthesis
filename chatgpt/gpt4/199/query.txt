The method java.rmi.server.RemoteRef.doneâ€‹(RemoteCall) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "1.2 style stubs no longer use this method. Instead of
 using a sequence of method calls to the remote reference
 (newCall, invoke, and done), a
 stub uses a single method, invoke(Remote, Method, Object[],
 int), on the remote reference to carry out parameter
 marshalling, remote method executing and unmarshalling of the return
 value."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
