Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example without additional context such as the specific use case, the overall code structure, and the desired outcome. However, I can provide a general example of how to refactor code to replace the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.RemoteRef.done(RemoteCall)` with the recommended method `java.rmi.server.RemoteRef.invoke(Remote, Method, Object[], int)`:

Before refactoring:
```
RemoteRef ref = ... // Obtain remote reference
RemoteCall call = ref.newCall(...); // Create new remote call
...
ref.invoke(call); // Execute remote method
ref.done(call); // Cleanup remote call
```

After refactoring:
```
RemoteRef ref = ... // Obtain remote reference
...
Method method = ... // Obtain method to execute remotely
Object[] args = ... // Set arguments for the method
int callID = ... // Generate a unique call ID
RemoteCall call = new RemoteCall(callID); // Create new remote call
...
ref.invoke(this, method, args, callID); // Execute remote method and handle marshalling/unmarshalling
```
