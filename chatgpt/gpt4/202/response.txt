Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot execute any code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.RemoteStub.setRef(RemoteStub, RemoteRef)` using the suggested alternative:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteStub;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteRef;

public class MyRemoteStub extends RemoteStub {
    
    public void setRemoteRef(RemoteRef ref) {
        setRef(this, ref); // using deprecated method
    }
    
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteStub;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteRef;

public class MyRemoteStub extends RemoteStub {
    
    public MyRemoteStub(RemoteRef ref) {
        super(ref);
    }
    
}
```

In this example, we no longer need the `setRemoteRef` method as we can directly set the remote reference of the `RemoteStub` object through its constructor `RemoteStub(RemoteRef)`. By using the constructor, we can avoid using the deprecated `setRef` method.
