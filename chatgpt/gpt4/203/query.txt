The method java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader.getSecurityContextâ€‹(ClassLoader) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "no replacement.  As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, RMI no
 longer uses this method to obtain a class loader's security context."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
