I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an executable refactoring example for this deprecation as it is not a code smell or a code issue that needs to be refactored. Instead, it is a notice that the method `java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader.getSecurityContext(ClassLoader)` is no longer used by RMI and has been deprecated without a replacement since the Java 2 platform v1.2. 

In other words, if you're using this method in your code, you can safely remove it without replacing it with any other method or code. However, you may need to update your code logic to ensure that the removal of this method does not cause any issues or break your application's functionality.
