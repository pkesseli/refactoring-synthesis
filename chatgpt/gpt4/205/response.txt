Unfortunately, as the deprecation comment suggests, there is no replacement for the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.Skeleton.dispatch(Remote, RemoteCall, int, long)`. This means that there is no direct refactoring example to provide. 

However, in general, when a method is deprecated and has no replacement, it is best to continue using the deprecated method until an alternative solution is available. It is also important to stay updated with the latest Java releases and documentation to be aware of any new solutions that may be introduced in the future.
