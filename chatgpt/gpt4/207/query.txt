The method java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject.exportObjectâ€‹(Remote) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is deprecated because it supports only static stubs.
 Use exportObject(Remote, port) or
 exportObject(Remote, port, csf, ssf)
 instead."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
