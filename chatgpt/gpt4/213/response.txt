Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can explain how to refactor the deprecated method call in Java.

Before refactoring:
```
Signature signature = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA");
signature.setParameter("keySize", 2048);
```

After refactoring:
```
Signature signature = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA");
signature.setParameter(AlgorithmParameterSpec.PARA‌​M_KEY_SIZE, 2048);
```

In this refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `setParameter` method call with the recommended `setParameter` method that takes an `AlgorithmParameterSpec` as its first argument. In this case, we are using the `AlgorithmParameterSpec.PARA‌​M_KEY_SIZE` constant to specify the key size.
