As a language model, I do not have access to your code or environment, so I cannot provide an executable example. However, I can provide a refactoring example in pseudocode:

Assuming you have the following code:

```
CallableStatement stmt = conn.prepareCall("{call my_stored_proc(?, ?)}");
stmt.setInt(1, id);
stmt.registerOutParameter(2, java.sql.Types.NUMERIC, 2);
stmt.execute();
BigDecimal result = stmt.getBigDecimal(2, 2);
```

Before refactoring:
```
stmt.getBigDecimal(2, 2);
```

After refactoring:
```
stmt.getBigDecimal("2");
```

or

```
stmt.getBigDecimal(2);
```

Explanation: The `getBigDecimal(int, int)` method is deprecated, so it's recommended to use `getBigDecimal(int)` or `getBigDecimal(String)` instead. In this case, we can use either of these methods as a replacement for the deprecated one.
