I'm sorry, but since the `java.sql.Date.getHours()` method is deprecated, it is recommended to use `java.time.LocalDateTime` instead. However, it is not possible to provide an executable refactoring example without understanding the context of the code that uses `java.sql.Date.getHours()`. Could you please provide more information about the code you're working with?
