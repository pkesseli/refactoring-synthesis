Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.sql.Date.setHours(int)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
date.setHours(15);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
java.sql.Timestamp timestamp = new java.sql.Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
timestamp.setHours(15);
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(timestamp.getTime());
``` 

In the refactored code, we first create a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, which has a similar `setHours(int)` method that is not deprecated. We set the hours on the `Timestamp` object, then create a `java.sql.Date` object from the `Timestamp` object's time in milliseconds using the `getTime()` method. This gives us a `Date` object with the same date and time as before, but with the hours set correctly without using the deprecated method.
