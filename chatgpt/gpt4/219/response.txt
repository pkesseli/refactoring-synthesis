# Response Time: 34.507922410964966
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot directly provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can explain what deprecation means and provide some guidance on how to refactor code.

Deprecation is a warning that a certain method, class, or interface is no longer recommended to use and might be removed in future releases. In this case, the `java.sql.Date.setMinutes(int)` method is deprecated, which means that it's no longer recommended to use it because there's a better alternative available, and it might be removed in future versions of Java.

To refactor code that uses the deprecated `setMinutes(int)` method, you should use the `setMinutes(int)` method of the `java.util.Calendar` class instead. Here's an example of how to do it:

```
// Before refactoring
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
date.setMinutes(30);

// After refactoring
java.util.Calendar calendar = java.util.Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
calendar.set(java.util.Calendar.MINUTE, 30);
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(calendar.getTimeInMillis());
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `java.util.Calendar` class, set its time to the current time, and then set the minutes to 30 using the `set` method. Finally, we create a new `java.sql.Date` object using the time in milliseconds obtained from the calendar.
