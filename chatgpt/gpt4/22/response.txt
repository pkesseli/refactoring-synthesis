Before refactoring:

```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
  public boolean isInside(int x, int y) {
    return inside(x, y);
  }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
  public boolean isInside(int x, int y) {
    return contains(x, y);
  }
}
```

Explanation:
The `inside(int, int)` method of the `Component` class is deprecated as of JDK version 1.1 and replaced by the `contains(int, int)` method. Therefore, in the `MyComponent` class, the `inside(int, int)` method should be replaced with `contains(int, int)` to avoid using a deprecated method.
