Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated method `java.sql.DriverManager.getLogStream()` to use the recommended method `java.sql.DriverManager.getLogWriter()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("Example");
    DriverManager.setLogStream(logger::info);
  }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("Example");
    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(System.out);
    DriverManager.setLogWriter(writer);
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, we import the `java.io.PrintWriter` class, which is needed to create a `PrintWriter` object that can be passed to `DriverManager.setLogWriter()`. We then replace the call to `DriverManager.setLogStream()` with a call to `DriverManager.setLogWriter()`, passing in the `PrintWriter` object that we created. This change should silence any deprecation warnings and ensure that the code continues to work as expected.
