Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `setUnicodeStream` method in `java.sql.PreparedStatement` to use the recommended `setCharacterStream` method instead:

<<< Before refactoring:

```
// Assume that we have a PreparedStatement object called "stmt"
// and a String variable called "data" that we want to insert into a database table

InputStream stream = new ByteArrayInputStream(data.getBytes("UTF-8"));
stmt.setUnicodeStream(1, stream, data.length());
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
// Assume that we have a PreparedStatement object called "stmt"
// and a String variable called "data" that we want to insert into a database table

Reader reader = new StringReader(data);
stmt.setCharacterStream(1, reader);
```

In this refactored code, we first create a `StringReader` object from the `data` string. Then, we use the `setCharacterStream` method on the `PreparedStatement` object to set the parameter at index `1` to the value of the `Reader` object. This way, we avoid using the deprecated `setUnicodeStream` method and use the recommended `setCharacterStream` method instead.
