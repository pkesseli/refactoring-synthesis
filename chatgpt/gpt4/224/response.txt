Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.sql.ResultSet.getBigDecimalâ€‹(int, int)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT price FROM products");
BigDecimal price = rs.getBigDecimal(1, 2);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT price FROM products");
BigDecimal price = rs.getBigDecimal("price");
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the use of `getBigDecimal(int, int)` with `getBigDecimal(String)`, as recommended in the Javadoc deprecation comment. The column name `"price"` is passed as a string argument to the `getBigDecimal` method instead of the column index. This code will achieve the same result as the original code, but with the use of a non-deprecated method.
