I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot perform executable refactoring examples in a specific programming language. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated method call in Java.

If you have code that uses the deprecated method `java.sql.ResultSet.getUnicodeStreamâ€‹(int)`, you can refactor it by replacing the method call with the non-deprecated method `java.sql.ResultSet.getCharacterStream(int)`. 

Here is a generic example of how the refactoring might look:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
try (ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql)) {
  while (rs.next()) {
    InputStream is = rs.getUnicodeStream(1);
    // do something with the InputStream
  }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
try (ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql)) {
  while (rs.next()) {
    Reader reader = rs.getCharacterStream(1);
    // do something with the Reader
  }
}
```

Note that the main difference is that the deprecated `getUnicodeStream()` method call has been replaced with the non-deprecated `getCharacterStream()` method call, and the `InputStream` has been replaced with a `Reader`.
