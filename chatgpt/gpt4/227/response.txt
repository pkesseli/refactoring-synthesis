Sure, here's an example refactoring code snippet:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
try {
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM my_table");
    while (resultSet.next()) {
        String data = "";
        InputStream inputStream = resultSet.getUnicodeStream("my_column");
        int character;
        while ((character = inputStream.read()) != -1) {
            data += (char) character;
        }
        System.out.println(data);
    }
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
try {
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM my_table");
    while (resultSet.next()) {
        String data = "";
        Reader characterStream = resultSet.getCharacterStream("my_column");
        int character;
        while ((character = characterStream.read()) != -1) {
            data += (char) character;
        }
        System.out.println(data);
    }
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the original code, the `getUnicodeStream` method is used to retrieve data from the database and convert it to a string. However, this method is deprecated and should be replaced with `getCharacterStream`. The refactored code uses `getCharacterStream` instead to retrieve the data as a character stream, which can then be read and converted to a string using the same logic as before.
