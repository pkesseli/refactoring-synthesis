# Response Time: 38.449134826660156
I'm sorry, but it is not possible to provide an executable refactoring example without knowing the context of the code that uses the `java.sql.Time.getDay()` method. The deprecation of this method means that it is no longer recommended for use and that there is an alternative method available that should be used instead. In general, the recommended approach would be to replace calls to the deprecated method with calls to the alternative method.

Here is an example refactoring that replaces a call to `java.sql.Time.getDay()` with a call to `java.time.LocalDateTime.getDayOfWeek()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.sql.Time;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Time time = new Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
        int day = time.getDay();
        System.out.println("Day: " + day);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        int dayOfWeek = dateTime.getDayOfWeek().getValue();
        System.out.println("Day of week: " + dayOfWeek);
    }
}
``` 

In this example, we replace the use of `java.sql.Time` with `java.time.LocalDateTime`, which provides a method `getDayOfWeek()` that returns a `java.time.DayOfWeek` enum. We then call the `getValue()` method of the `DayOfWeek` enum to get the integer value of the day of the week. This refactored code will produce the same result as the original code but avoids using the deprecated `java.sql.Time.getDay()` method.
