Sure! Here's an example:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```java
import java.awt.Button;

public class MyButton extends Button {
    public MyButton(String label) {
        super(label);
    }

    public boolean isMyButtonFocusable() {
        return isFocusTraversable();
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.Button;

public class MyButton extends Button {
    public MyButton(String label) {
        super(label);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isFocusable() {
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a custom button class called `MyButton` that extends the `java.awt.Button` class. The `isMyButtonFocusable` method in this class simply returns the result of calling the `isFocusTraversable` method, which is now deprecated.

To refactor this code, we need to replace the deprecated `isFocusTraversable` method with the new `isFocusable` method. We can also mark this method as an override using the `@Override` annotation to indicate that we're replacing the behavior of the superclass method.

In the refactored code, we've replaced the `isMyButtonFocusable` method with an overridden `isFocusable` method that always returns `true`, indicating that this button is focusable. This achieves the same behavior as the original code, but without using the deprecated method.
