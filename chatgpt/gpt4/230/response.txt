As `java.sql.Time.getMonth()` is deprecated, you can use `java.time.LocalTime` instead, which provides a non-deprecated `getMonthValue()` method. Here's an example of how to refactor the code:

<<< Before refactoring:

```
java.sql.Time time = new java.sql.Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
int month = time.getMonth();
System.out.println("Month: " + month);
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
java.time.LocalTime time = java.time.LocalTime.now();
int month = time.getMonthValue();
System.out.println("Month: " + month);
``` 

In this refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `java.sql.Time` with the non-deprecated `java.time.LocalTime`. We also replaced the deprecated `getMonth()` method with the non-deprecated `getMonthValue()` method. Finally, we used `LocalTime.now()` to get the current time instead of `System.currentTimeMillis()`, which is used to get the current time in milliseconds and is not necessary in this case.
