Sure, here's an executable refactoring example to replace the deprecated method `java.sql.Time.getYear()` with its recommended alternative:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.sql.Time;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Time time = new Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
        int year = time.getYear() + 1900;
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.sql.Time;
import java.util.Calendar;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Time time = new Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
        calendar.setTime(time);
        int year = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated method `getYear()` with `Calendar.YEAR`, which provides the year field value of the given `Calendar` instance. We have also created a new `Calendar` instance and set its time using the `setTime()` method. Finally, we have retrieved the year value using the `get()` method on the `Calendar` instance.
