# Response Time: 14.653663396835327
I'm sorry, but the `java.sql.Time` class does not have a `setMonth(int)` method. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an example of refactoring the deprecated method. 

The `java.sql.Time` class has a `setTime(long)` method, which sets the time value for the `Time` object using the specified milliseconds time value. This method is not deprecated and can be used to set the time value for a `Time` object. 

If you have a different code example that you would like me to help you refactor, please let me know.
