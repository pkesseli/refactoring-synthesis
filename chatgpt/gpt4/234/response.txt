# Response Time: 24.753963470458984
Sure, here's an example:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
Time time = new Time(0);
time.setYear(2022);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
Time time = Time.valueOf(LocalTime.from(dateTime));
time = new Time(time.getTime() + TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(365));
```

Explanation:
The `java.sql.Time` class is used to represent time values (hours, minutes, seconds) and has a deprecated `setYear(int)` method. Instead of using this method, we can refactor the code to use the modern `java.time` API which offers better functionality and is recommended by the Java documentation. In the refactored code, we first create a `LocalDateTime` object to get the current date and time, then we create a `Time` object from the current time using the `LocalTime.from()` method. Finally, we add a year to the `Time` object using the `TimeUnit` class to avoid the deprecated method.
