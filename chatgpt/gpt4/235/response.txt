Before refactoring: 

```
AtomicBoolean flag = new AtomicBoolean(false);
boolean oldVal = flag.get();
boolean newVal = !oldVal;
while (!flag.weakCompareAndSet(oldVal, newVal)) {
  oldVal = flag.get();
  newVal = !oldVal;
}
```

After refactoring:

```
AtomicBoolean flag = new AtomicBoolean(false);
boolean oldVal = flag.get();
boolean newVal = !oldVal;
while (!flag.weakCompareAndSetPlain(oldVal, newVal)) {
  oldVal = flag.get();
  newVal = !oldVal;
}
```

In this example, the method `weakCompareAndSet` is replaced with the recommended `weakCompareAndSetPlain` method. The `while` loop is used to repeatedly attempt to update the value of the `AtomicBoolean` until it succeeds, which is a common use case for this class. The use of `weakCompareAndSetPlain` ensures that the code behaves correctly and avoids any confusion over plain or volatile memory effects.
