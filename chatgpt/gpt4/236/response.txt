Before refactoring:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class Example {
    private final AtomicInteger value = new AtomicInteger();

    public void increment() {
        int current;
        do {
            current = value.get();
        } while (!value.compareAndSet(current, current + 1));
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class Example {
    private final AtomicInteger value = new AtomicInteger();

    public void increment() {
        int current;
        do {
            current = value.get();
        } while (!value.weakCompareAndSetPlain(current, current + 1));
    }
}
```

Explanation: 
The `compareAndSet(int, int)` method in `AtomicInteger` class has volatile memory effects, while the `weakCompareAndSet(int, int)` method has plain memory effects. The method `weakCompareAndSetPlain(int, int)` has been introduced to replace `weakCompareAndSet(int, int)` to avoid confusion. In this refactoring example, we have replaced the `compareAndSet` method with the `weakCompareAndSetPlain` method to use the recommended API.
