Before refactoring:

```
AtomicIntegerArray arr = new AtomicIntegerArray(10);
int expected = 1;
int newVal = 2;
int index = 5;
arr.weakCompareAndSet(index, expected, newVal);
```

After refactoring:

```
AtomicIntegerArray arr = new AtomicIntegerArray(10);
int expected = 1;
int newVal = 2;
int index = 5;
arr.weakCompareAndSetPlain(index, expected, newVal);
```

Explanation:

The `weakCompareAndSet()` method in `AtomicIntegerArray` is deprecated because its name implies volatile memory effects, but it actually has plain memory effects. This can cause confusion and potential bugs in multi-threaded code. To avoid this confusion, the recommended approach is to use the `weakCompareAndSetPlain()` method instead, which makes it clear that only plain memory effects are being used.
