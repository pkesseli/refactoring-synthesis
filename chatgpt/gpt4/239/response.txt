I apologize, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example for a specific codebase. However, I can provide a general example of how the method can be refactored based on the deprecation comment in the Javadoc.

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
AtomicLongArray arr = new AtomicLongArray(10);
int index = 5;
long expected = 100L;
long update = 200L;
boolean result = arr.weakCompareAndSet(index, expected, update);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
AtomicLongArray arr = new AtomicLongArray(10);
int index = 5;
long expected = 100L;
long update = 200L;
boolean result = arr.weakCompareAndSetPlain(index, expected, update);
``` 
Note: In this example, we have replaced the deprecated method `weakCompareAndSet` with the recommended method `weakCompareAndSetPlain`.
