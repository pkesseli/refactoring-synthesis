Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `java.awt.Component.keyDown(Event, int)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component implements KeyListener {

    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        // handle key press event
        keyDown(e, e.getKeyCode());
    }

    // Other KeyListener methods here

}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component implements KeyListener {

    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        // handle key press event
        processKeyEvent(e);
    }

    // Other KeyListener methods here

}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `keyDown` method with the suggested replacement, `processKeyEvent`. This should ensure that the code continues to function correctly even with future versions of Java.
