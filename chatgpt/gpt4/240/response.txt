Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable code example as I do not have the context or understanding of the specific codebase you are working on. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method to its recommended replacement based on the Javadoc comment:

Before refactoring:
```
AtomicReference<String> myReference = new AtomicReference<>("initialValue");
myReference.weakCompareAndSet("initialValue", "newValue");
```

After refactoring:
```
AtomicReference<String> myReference = new AtomicReference<>("initialValue");
myReference.weakCompareAndSetPlain("initialValue", "newValue");
```

Note that in the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `weakCompareAndSet` method with its recommended replacement, `weakCompareAndSetPlain`.
