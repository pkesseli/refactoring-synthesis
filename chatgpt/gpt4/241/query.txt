The method java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReferenceArray.weakCompareAndSetâ€‹(int, E, E) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has plain memory effects but the method
 name implies volatile memory effects (see methods such as
 AtomicReferenceArray.compareAndExchange(int, E, E) and AtomicReferenceArray.compareAndSet(int, E, E)).  To avoid
 confusion over plain or volatile memory effects it is recommended that
 the method AtomicReferenceArray.weakCompareAndSetPlain(int, E, E) be used instead."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
