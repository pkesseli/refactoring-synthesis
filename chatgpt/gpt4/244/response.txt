Sure, here's an example refactoring code for you:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.util.Date;

public class Example {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Date date = new Date();
      int dayOfWeek = date.getDay();
      System.out.println("Today is day " + dayOfWeek);
   }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.util.Calendar;

public class Example {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
      int dayOfWeek = calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK);
      System.out.println("Today is day " + dayOfWeek);
   }
}
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the usage of `Date.getDay()` method with `Calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK)` method, as suggested by the deprecation comment in the Javadoc. We first instantiate a `Calendar` object using `Calendar.getInstance()` method, and then use `Calendar.get()` method with the `Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK` field to get the day of the week.
