Sure! Here's an example refactoring in Java that replaces the deprecated `getHours()` method with the recommended `get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
import java.util.Date;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date now = new Date();
        int hours = now.getHours();
        System.out.println("The hour is: " + hours);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
import java.util.Calendar;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calendar now = Calendar.getInstance();
        int hours = now.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);
        System.out.println("The hour is: " + hours);
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `getHours()` method with `get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY)` and instantiated a `Calendar` object using `Calendar.getInstance()`. This should result in the same output as before, but now we're using the recommended method for obtaining the hour of the day.
