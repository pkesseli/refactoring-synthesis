The method java.util.Date.getTimezoneOffset() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by -(Calendar.get(Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET) +
 Calendar.get(Calendar.DST_OFFSET)) / (60 * 1000)."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
