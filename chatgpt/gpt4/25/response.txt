Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable example as I cannot interact with the local environment and execute code. However, I can provide a refactoring example in pseudo-code that demonstrates how to refactor the deprecated `java.awt.Component.keyUp(Event, int)` method to its suggested replacement `processKeyEvent(KeyEvent)`.

Before refactoring:
```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    @Override
    public boolean keyUp(Event evt, int key) {
        if (key == KeyEvent.VK_ENTER) {
            // Do something
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    @Override
    public boolean processKeyEvent(KeyEvent evt) {
        if (evt.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_ENTER && evt.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED) {
            // Do something
        }
        return super.processKeyEvent(evt);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we replace the `keyUp(Event, int)` method with the suggested replacement `processKeyEvent(KeyEvent)` method. In the new implementation, we check the key code and event ID to determine if the key is the Enter key and it has been released. If so, we execute the desired logic. Finally, we call the `super.processKeyEvent(evt)` method to handle any other key events.
