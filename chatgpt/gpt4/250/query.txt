The method java.util.Date.getYear() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by Calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 1900."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
