Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
Date date = new Date();
date.setMinutes(30);
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.setTime(new Date());
calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 30);
Date date = calendar.getTime();
```

Explanation: 

In the original code, a `Date` object was created and the `setMinutes()` method was used to set its minutes to 30. However, as mentioned in the deprecation comment, this method is no longer recommended and should be replaced with `Calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, int minutes)`.

So in the refactored code, we create a `Calendar` object using `Calendar.getInstance()`. We set its time using the `setTime()` method and pass in a new `Date` object. Then we use `set(Calendar.MINUTE, int minutes)` to set the minutes to 30. Finally, we get a `Date` object from the `Calendar` using `getTime()`. This updated code achieves the same result without using the deprecated `setMinutes()` method.
