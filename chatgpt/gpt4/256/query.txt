The method java.util.Date.setSecondsâ€‹(int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by Calendar.set(Calendar.SECOND, int seconds)."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
