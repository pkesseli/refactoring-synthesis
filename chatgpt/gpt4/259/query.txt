The method java.util.Date.toLocaleString() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by DateFormat.format(Date date)."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
