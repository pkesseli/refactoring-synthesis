I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to your codebase and cannot provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor your code to replace the deprecated `java.awt.Component.layout()` method with the recommended `doLayout()` method.

Here's an example of how you can refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
// Creating a panel
JPanel panel = new JPanel();

// Setting the layout of the panel
panel.layout();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
// Creating a panel
JPanel panel = new JPanel();

// Setting the layout of the panel
panel.doLayout();
```

In this example, we've simply replaced the deprecated `layout()` method with the recommended `doLayout()` method on the `JPanel` component. 

Note that simply replacing the deprecated method with the recommended method might not always be enough, as other parts of your codebase may depend on the old method. It is recommended to carefully review your codebase and make sure that the deprecated method is no longer used before removing it completely.
