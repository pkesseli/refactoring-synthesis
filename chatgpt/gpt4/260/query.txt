The method java.util.Date.UTCâ€‹(int, int, int, int, int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by Calendar.set(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec)
 or GregorianCalendar(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec), using a UTC
 TimeZone, followed by Calendar.getTime().getTime()."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
