The method java.util.logging.LogRecord.setMillisâ€‹(long) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "LogRecord maintains timestamps with nanosecond resolution,
             using Instant values. For this reason,
             setInstant()
             should be used in preference to setMillis()."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
