The method java.util.Properties.saveâ€‹(OutputStream, String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not throw an IOException if an I/O error
 occurs while saving the property list.  The preferred way to save a
 properties list is via the store(OutputStream out,
 String comments) method or the
 storeToXML(OutputStream os, String comment) method."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
