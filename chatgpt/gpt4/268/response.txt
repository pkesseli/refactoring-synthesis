I'm sorry, but it is not possible to refactor the `finalize()` method of `javax.imageio.spi.ServiceRegistry` class, as it is a deprecated method and is no longer recommended to be used. The deprecation warning indicates that the subclasses that override `finalize()` method should use alternative cleanup mechanisms and remove the overridden `finalize()` method. 

Instead of refactoring the `finalize()` method, you should follow the recommendation and replace it with a different mechanism for cleanup. One of the alternatives is to use the `try-with-resources` statement to ensure that the resources are closed properly, or use a `finally` block to release the resources acquired by the subclass. 

Here's an example of how you could use the `try-with-resources` statement to handle cleanup in the `ServiceRegistry` class:

```
// Before refactoring
public class MyServiceRegistry extends ServiceRegistry {
    // ...
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // cleanup code here
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}

// After refactoring
public class MyServiceRegistry extends ServiceRegistry {
    // ...
    @Override
    public void close() throws IOException {
        // cleanup code here
    }
}
```

In this example, instead of overriding the `finalize()` method, we have implemented the `close()` method to perform the cleanup. This method can be called explicitly by the user, or it can be used with the `try-with-resources` statement to ensure that the resources are properly released.
