I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or project context, so I cannot provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor your code based on the deprecation comment you provided.

The deprecation comment suggests that if you have a subclass that overrides the `finalize()` method to perform cleanup, you should modify it to use alternative cleanup mechanisms and remove the `finalize()` method. The comment also suggests that when overriding the `finalize()` method, you should make sure to explicitly invoke `super.finalize()` as described in `Object.finalize()`.

Here's an example of how you could refactor your code based on these guidelines:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
public class MyImageInputStream extends FileCacheImageInputStream {
    
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        // Perform cleanup here
        super.finalize();
    }
    
    // Other methods and fields
}
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
public class MyImageInputStream extends FileCacheImageInputStream {
    
    public void close() throws IOException {
        // Perform cleanup here
        super.close();
    }
    
    // Other methods and fields
}
```

In this example, instead of overriding the `finalize()` method, we've added a `close()` method that performs the same cleanup tasks. We've also removed the call to `super.finalize()` since it's no longer necessary. Finally, we've modified any code that used the old `finalize()` method to use the new `close()` method instead.
