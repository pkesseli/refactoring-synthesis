Before refactoring:
```
Component component = somePanel.locate(x, y);
```

After refactoring:
```
Component component = somePanel.getComponentAt(x, y);
``` 

Explanation: The `locate(int x, int y)` method of `java.awt.Component` is deprecated and has been replaced by `getComponentAt(int x, int y)` method. Hence, the recommended approach is to use `getComponentAt(int x, int y)` instead of `locate(int x, int y)`.
