I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment to perform a refactoring. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated `finalize()` method in `FileImageInputStream` based on the deprecation comment you provided:

Before refactoring:
```
public class MyImageInputStream extends FileImageInputStream {
    
    public MyImageInputStream(File file) throws IOException {
        super(file);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            close();
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
public class MyImageInputStream extends FileImageInputStream {
    
    private boolean isClosed = false;
    
    public MyImageInputStream(File file) throws IOException {
        super(file);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void close() throws IOException {
        if (!isClosed) {
            super.close();
            isClosed = true;
        }
    }
}
```
In this refactored code, instead of using `finalize()` to perform cleanup, we create a `isClosed` flag to track whether the input stream has been closed or not. We then override the `close()` method to perform the necessary cleanup and set the `isClosed` flag to `true`. This ensures that the `FileImageInputStream` is properly cleaned up without relying on the deprecated `finalize()` method.
