Before refactoring: 

```
public class MyImageOutputStream extends FileImageOutputStream {

   public MyImageOutputStream(File file) throws FileNotFoundException {
       super(file);
   }

   @Override
   protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
       try {
           close();
       } finally {
           super.finalize();
       }
   }

}
```

After refactoring:

```
public class MyImageOutputStream extends FileImageOutputStream {

   public MyImageOutputStream(File file) throws FileNotFoundException {
       super(file);
   }

   public void closeStream() throws IOException {
       close();
   }
}
```

Explanation: 
The above code defines a class `MyImageOutputStream` which extends `FileImageOutputStream` and overrides the `finalize()` method to call the `close()` method. However, since `finalize()` is deprecated, this method should be removed and replaced with an alternative cleanup mechanism. In this case, the `close()` method should be called explicitly when the stream is no longer needed, and the `finalize()` method should be removed from the class definition. The refactored code provides a new method `closeStream()` which can be called to explicitly close the stream.
