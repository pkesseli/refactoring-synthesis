The method javax.imageio.stream.ImageInputStreamImpl.finalize() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The finalize method has been deprecated.
     Subclasses that override finalize in order to perform cleanup
     should be modified to use alternative cleanup mechanisms and
     to remove the overriding finalize method.
     When overriding the finalize method, its implementation must explicitly
     ensure that super.finalize() is invoked as described in Object.finalize().
     See the specification for Object.finalize() for further
     information about migration options."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
