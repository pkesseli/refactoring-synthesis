I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase, and I cannot provide executable refactoring examples without any context. 

However, I can give you some guidance on how to approach this deprecation warning. The deprecation comment suggests that you should modify your code to use alternative cleanup mechanisms instead of relying on the `finalize` method. This means that you should find a way to perform the cleanup operations explicitly, without relying on the garbage collector to call the `finalize` method.

One alternative cleanup mechanism you can use is the `try-with-resources` statement. This statement ensures that any resources that are opened in the `try` block are closed after the execution of the `try` block, even if an exception is thrown.

Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the `try-with-resources` statement instead of relying on the `finalize` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public class MyImageInputStream extends ImageInputStreamImpl {

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        // Cleanup operations
        super.finalize();
    }

}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public class MyImageInputStream extends ImageInputStreamImpl {

    // No need to override finalize method

    public void close() throws IOException {
        // Cleanup operations
        super.close();
    }

}
```

In this example, we've replaced the `finalize` method with a new method called `close`, which performs the necessary cleanup operations explicitly. We've also extended the `IOException` to handle any exceptions that might occur during the cleanup.
