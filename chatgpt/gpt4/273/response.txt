I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase, so I can't provide you with a specific example to refactor your code. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated finalize method:

Before refactoring:
```
class MyImageInputStream extends MemoryCacheImageInputStream {
    // ...
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // Perform cleanup operations
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

After refactoring:
```
class MyImageInputStream extends MemoryCacheImageInputStream {
    // ...
    public void close() throws IOException {
        try {
            // Perform cleanup operations
        } finally {
            super.close();
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```
In the refactored code, the finalize method has been replaced with the close method, which is called explicitly by the client code to release any resources associated with the stream. This approach ensures that the cleanup operations are performed in a timely and deterministic manner, rather than relying on the garbage collector to eventually call the finalize method.
