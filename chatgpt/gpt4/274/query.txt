The method javax.management.AttributeValueExp.setMBeanServerâ€‹(MBeanServer) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has no effect.  The MBean Server used to
 obtain an attribute value is QueryEval.getMBeanServer()."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
