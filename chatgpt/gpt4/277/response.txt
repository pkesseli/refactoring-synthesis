I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I do not have access to your codebase to provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor the code to address the deprecation warning.

Before refactoring: 

```java
byte[] serializedObj = ... // Serialized object to be deserialized
ObjectName objectName = ... // Object name of the MBean
MBeanServer mbeanServer = ... // MBeanServer instance
Object obj = mbeanServer.deserialize(objectName, serializedObj);
```

After refactoring: 

```java
byte[] serializedObj = ... // Serialized object to be deserialized
ObjectName objectName = ... // Object name of the MBean
MBeanServer mbeanServer = ... // MBeanServer instance
ClassLoader classLoader = mbeanServer.getClassLoaderFor(objectName);
Object obj = deserializeObject(serializedObj, classLoader);
```

In the refactored code, instead of directly calling the deprecated `deserialize` method, we first obtain the appropriate class loader for deserialization using the `getClassLoaderFor` method. Then, we pass the serialized object and class loader to a new method called `deserializeObject` which handles the deserialization of the object using the given class loader.

Note that you will need to implement the `deserializeObject` method yourself, using the appropriate deserialization library and techniques for your use case.
