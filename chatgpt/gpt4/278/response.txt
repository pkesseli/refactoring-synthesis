Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor.getDerivedGauge()` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;

public class Example {
    private CounterMonitor monitor;
    
    public void update() {
        double gaugeValue = monitor.getDerivedGauge();
        System.out.println("Gauge value: " + gaugeValue);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import javax.management.ObjectName;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;

public class Example {
    private CounterMonitor monitor;
    private ObjectName objectName;
    
    public void update() {
        double gaugeValue = monitor.getDerivedGauge(objectName);
        System.out.println("Gauge value: " + gaugeValue);
    }
}
```

In this example, we first import the `javax.management.ObjectName` class, which is needed to use the replacement method `CounterMonitor.getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)`.

Then, we modify the `update()` method to use the new method, passing in an `ObjectName` instance that represents the MBean to monitor. The `ObjectName` can be constructed using the `javax.management.ObjectName(String)` constructor.

By making these changes, we have updated the code to use the new replacement method and avoided using the deprecated method, which should help ensure that the code remains compatible with future versions of JMX.
