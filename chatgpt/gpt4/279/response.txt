Sure, here's an executable refactoring example:

Assume we have the following code snippet that uses the deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method:

```
// Creating a CounterMonitor
CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();

// Getting the derived gauge timestamp
long derivedGaugeTimestamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

To refactor this code to use the recommended method, `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)`, we can modify the code as follows:

```
// Creating a CounterMonitor
CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();

// Getting the ObjectName of the MBean
ObjectName mbeanName = counterMonitor.getObservedObject();

// Getting the derived gauge timestamp
long derivedGaugeTimestamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(mbeanName);
```

In this refactored code, we first get the `ObjectName` of the MBean being monitored by calling `getObservedObject()`. Then, we pass this `ObjectName` to the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method to get the derived gauge timestamp. This code will work as expected and will not use any deprecated methods.
