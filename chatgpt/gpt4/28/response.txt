I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to execute code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.location()` method to use the recommended replacement method `getLocation()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Point;

public class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    public void exampleMethod() {
        Point location = location();
        System.out.println("The component's location is: " + location);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Point;

public class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    public void exampleMethod() {
        Point location = getLocation();
        System.out.println("The component's location is: " + location);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `location()` method with the recommended replacement method `getLocation()`. The rest of the code remains the same.
