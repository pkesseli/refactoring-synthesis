Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor.getThreshold()` using the replacement method `CounterMonitor.getThreshold(ObjectName)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;

public class MyMonitor {
    private CounterMonitor counterMonitor;

    public MyMonitor(CounterMonitor counterMonitor) {
        this.counterMonitor = counterMonitor;
    }

    public long getThreshold() {
        return counterMonitor.getThreshold();
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import javax.management.ObjectName;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;

public class MyMonitor {
    private CounterMonitor counterMonitor;

    public MyMonitor(CounterMonitor counterMonitor) {
        this.counterMonitor = counterMonitor;
    }

    public long getThreshold(ObjectName objectName) {
        return counterMonitor.getThreshold(objectName);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `getThreshold()` method with the new `getThreshold(ObjectName)` method. The `ObjectName` argument is now required, which allows the caller to specify which MBean object the threshold should be retrieved from. This change ensures compatibility with JMX 1.2 and higher versions.
