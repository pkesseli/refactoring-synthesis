Sure, here's an example refactoring:

Before refactoring:
```
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;

CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
counterMonitor.setThreshold(10);
```

After refactoring:
```
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;

CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
counterMonitor.setInitThreshold(10);
```
