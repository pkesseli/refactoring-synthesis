I'm sorry, as a language model, I do not have access to your codebase, so I cannot provide an executable refactoring example for your specific code. However, here is an example of how you can refactor your code to use the replacement method:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = ...;
Number derivedGauge = counterMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = ...;
ObjectName objectName = ...; // specify the ObjectName of the MBean being monitored
Number derivedGauge = counterMonitor.getDerivedGauge(objectName);
``` 

In the above refactored code, instead of using the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method, we use the replacement method `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` which takes the `ObjectName` of the MBean being monitored as a parameter.
