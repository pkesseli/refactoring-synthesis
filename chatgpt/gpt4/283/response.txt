Unfortunately, as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with a general refactoring example that you can adapt to your specific codebase.

Before refactoring:

```
CounterMonitorMBean monitor = new CounterMonitor();
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyCounter");
long timeStamp = monitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

After refactoring:

```
CounterMonitorMBean monitor = new CounterMonitor();
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyCounter");
long timeStamp = monitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
``` 

Note that we've replaced the deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method with the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method, passing in the appropriate `ObjectName` argument.
