Assuming that you have an instance of `GaugeMonitor` and you're using the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method to obtain a derived gauge value, you could refactor your code as follows:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
GaugeMonitor gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor();
// ...
Number derivedGaugeValue = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
GaugeMonitor gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor();
// ...
ObjectName objectName = gaugeMonitor.getObservedObject();
String attribute = gaugeMonitor.getObservedAttribute();
Number derivedGaugeValue = (Number) connection.getAttribute(objectName, attribute);
```

In the refactored code, we obtain the `ObjectName` and `attribute` values from the `GaugeMonitor` instance, and use the `connection` object (assumed to be a valid `MBeanServerConnection` instance) to obtain the attribute value directly, without relying on the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method. This way, we're using the replacement method `GaugeMonitor.getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` instead.
