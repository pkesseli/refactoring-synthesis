Assuming that the original code is using the deprecated method javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(), here's an example of how to refactor it using the new method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
// Creating an instance of the GaugeMonitor class
GaugeMonitor monitor = new GaugeMonitor();
// Setting some attributes for the monitor, including a ObjectName
monitor.setObservedObject(objectName);
monitor.setGranularityPeriod(10000);
monitor.start();

// Getting the timestamp of the last gauge value change
long lastTimeStamp = monitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
// Creating an instance of the GaugeMonitor class
GaugeMonitor monitor = new GaugeMonitor();
// Setting some attributes for the monitor, including a ObjectName
monitor.setObservedObject(objectName);
monitor.setGranularityPeriod(10000);
monitor.start();

// Getting the timestamp of the last gauge value change using the new method
ObjectName monitorName = monitor.getObservedObject();
long lastTimeStamp = (Long) connection.getAttribute(monitorName, "DerivedGaugeTimeStamp");
``` 

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated method call "monitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()" with a call to the new method "connection.getAttribute(monitorName, "DerivedGaugeTimeStamp")", where "connection" is a valid JMX connection to the MBean server and "monitorName" is the ObjectName of the GaugeMonitor instance.
