Before refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitorMBean gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor();
// ...
long derivedGaugeTimeStamp = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

After refactoring:
```
GaugeMonitorMBean gaugeMonitor = new GaugeMonitor();
// ...
ObjectName objectName = gaugeMonitor.getObservedObject();
long derivedGaugeTimeStamp = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
``` 

Explanation:
The `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method is deprecated, and it is recommended to use `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` instead. The latter method takes an `ObjectName` parameter, which represents the object being monitored. In the example, we first obtain the `ObjectName` using `getObservedObject()` method and then use it to call `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method to get the derived gauge time stamp.
