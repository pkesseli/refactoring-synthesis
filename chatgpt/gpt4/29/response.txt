Unfortunately, as a language model, I am not able to provide an executable refactoring example since I do not have access to a development environment or codebase. However, I can provide a general refactoring example based on the deprecation comment you provided:

Before refactoring:
```java
public void lostFocus(Event evt, Object obj) {
    // handle lost focus event
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
public void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent evt) {
    if (evt.getID() == FocusEvent.FOCUS_LOST) {
        // handle lost focus event
    }
}
```

In this example, we replaced the deprecated `lostFocus(Event, Object)` method with the recommended `processFocusEvent(FocusEvent)` method. We also added a check for the `FOCUS_LOST` event ID to ensure that the method only handles lost focus events. Note that this is just a general refactoring example and may not be applicable to all use cases.
