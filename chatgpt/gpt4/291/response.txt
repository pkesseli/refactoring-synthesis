Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated method `javax.management.monitor.Monitor.setObservedObject(ObjectName)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Monitor monitor = new Monitor();
ObjectName observedObject = new ObjectName("mydomain:type=MyMBean");
monitor.setObservedObject(observedObject);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Monitor monitor = new Monitor();
ObjectName observedObject = new ObjectName("mydomain:type=MyMBean");
monitor.addObservedObject(observedObject);
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated method `setObservedObject` with the recommended method `addObservedObject` to avoid using the deprecated method. This will ensure that our code is compatible with future versions of JMX.
