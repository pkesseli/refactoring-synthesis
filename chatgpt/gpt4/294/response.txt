Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to modify or execute code. However, I can provide you with an example of how you can refactor the deprecated method `javax.management.monitor.StringMonitor.getDerivedGauge()` using the suggested replacement `StringMonitor.getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)`.

Before refactoring:
```
StringMonitor stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
String derivedGauge = stringMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
```

After refactoring:
```
StringMonitor stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("domain:name=StringMonitor");
String derivedGauge = (String) stringMonitor.getDerivedGauge(objectName);
```

Note that in the refactored code, we are using the `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` method instead of the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method. We are also passing an `ObjectName` parameter to the method, which specifies the name of the `StringMonitor` MBean.
