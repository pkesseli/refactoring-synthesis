Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable code example as I do not have access to the specific context or environment where the code is being used. However, I can provide a general refactoring example as follows:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
import javax.management.monitor.StringMonitor;

public class MyClass {
    private StringMonitor stringMonitor;

    public MyClass() {
        // Initialize the stringMonitor object
        stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
    }

    public long getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp() {
        return stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
import javax.management.monitor.StringMonitor;
import javax.management.ObjectName;

public class MyClass {
    private StringMonitor stringMonitor;

    public MyClass() {
        // Initialize the stringMonitor object
        stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
    }

    public long getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp() {
        ObjectName objectName = stringMonitor.getObservedObject();
        return stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
    }
}
```

In this example, the deprecated method `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` is replaced with the recommended method `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)`. This new method takes an `ObjectName` parameter that represents the object being monitored by the `StringMonitor`. Therefore, before calling this method, we need to retrieve the `ObjectName` using the `getObservedObject()` method.
