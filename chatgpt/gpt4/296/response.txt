I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to your codebase, so I cannot provide you with an executable refactoring example. However, I can explain what the deprecation comment means and provide you with guidance on how to refactor your code.

The deprecation comment "As of JMX 1.2, replaced by StringMonitorMBean.getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)" means that the method `getDerivedGauge()` in the `StringMonitorMBean` class is no longer recommended for use and has been replaced by a new method `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` in the same class. The new method takes an `ObjectName` parameter, which specifies the MBean on which to perform the monitor calculation.

To refactor your code, you should replace all calls to the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method with calls to the new `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` method, passing in the appropriate `ObjectName` parameter. Here's an example:

<<< Before refactoring:
StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor = // initialize StringMonitorMBean
String derivedGauge = stringMonitor.getDerivedGauge(); // call deprecated method

>>> After refactoring:
StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor = // initialize StringMonitorMBean
ObjectName mbeanName = // create ObjectName for MBean
String derivedGauge = stringMonitor.getDerivedGauge(mbeanName); // call new method with ObjectName parameter

Note that you will need to create an appropriate `ObjectName` for the MBean you want to monitor and pass it as a parameter to the new method.
