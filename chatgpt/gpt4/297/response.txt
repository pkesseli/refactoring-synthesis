Before refactoring: 

```java
import javax.management.monitor.StringMonitorMBean;

public class StringMonitorExample {
    private StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor;

    public long getLastUpdatedTimestamp() {
        return stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.ObjectName;
import javax.management.monitor.StringMonitorMBean;

public class StringMonitorExample {
    private StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor;

    public long getLastUpdatedTimestamp() {
        ObjectName objectName = stringMonitor.getObservedObject();
        return stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

The `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method of the `StringMonitorMBean` class is deprecated and has been replaced by the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method. The new method requires an `ObjectName` parameter, which represents the MBean that is being monitored. Therefore, we need to refactor our code to use this new method.

In the refactored code, we first obtain the `ObjectName` of the MBean being monitored by calling the `getObservedObject()` method of the `StringMonitorMBean` class. We then pass this `ObjectName` as a parameter to the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method to obtain the last updated timestamp of the derived gauge.
