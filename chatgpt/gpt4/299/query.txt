The method javax.management.ValueExp.setMBeanServerâ€‹(MBeanServer) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is not needed because a
 ValueExp can access the MBean server in which it
 is being evaluated by using QueryEval.getMBeanServer()."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
