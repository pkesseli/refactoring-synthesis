The method com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean.getSystemCpuLoad() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Use OperatingSystemMXBean.getCpuLoad() instead of
 this historically named method."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
