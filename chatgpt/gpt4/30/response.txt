As an AI language model, I don't have access to an actual codebase to demonstrate refactoring examples. However, I can provide a hypothetical example based on the given deprecation message.

Assuming you have the following code that uses `minimumSize()` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void someMethod() {
        // ...
        Dimension minSize = minimumSize();
        // ...
    }
}
```

You can refactor it by replacing `minimumSize()` with `getMinimumSize()` method:

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void someMethod() {
        // ...
        Dimension minSize = getMinimumSize();
        // ...
    }
}
```

By doing so, your code will no longer use the deprecated `minimumSize()` method, and will be compatible with JDK versions 1.1 and above.
