Sorry, as I'm a language model, I don't have access to your existing codebase to refactor it. However, here is an example of how to refactor the code that uses the deprecated method `javax.net.ssl.HandshakeCompletedEvent.getPeerCertificateChain()`.

Assuming you have the following code:

```
// Before refactoring:
import javax.net.ssl.HandshakeCompletedEvent;
import java.security.cert.Certificate[];

class MyListener implements javax.net.ssl.HandshakeCompletedListener {
    public void handshakeCompleted(HandshakeCompletedEvent event) {
        Certificate[] peerCertificates = event.getPeerCertificateChain();
        // ... use peerCertificates
    }
}
```

You can refactor it as follows:

```
// After refactoring:
import javax.net.ssl.HandshakeCompletedEvent;
import java.security.cert.Certificate[];

class MyListener implements javax.net.ssl.HandshakeCompletedListener {
    public void handshakeCompleted(HandshakeCompletedEvent event) {
        Certificate[] peerCertificates = event.getPeerCertificates();
        // ... use peerCertificates
    }
}
```

In this example, we simply replaced the call to `event.getPeerCertificateChain()` with `event.getPeerCertificates()`, as recommended by the deprecation comment.
