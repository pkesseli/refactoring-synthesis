Sure, here's an example:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.*;

public class MyButton extends JButton {
    public void doSomething() {
        String label = getLabel();
        // some code here
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.*;

public class MyButton extends JButton {
    public void doSomething() {
        String text = getText();
        // some code here
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have updated the `getLabel()` method to `getText()` in the `doSomething()` method of the `MyButton` class. This is because the `getLabel()` method has been deprecated and replaced with `getText()`. By making this change, our code is now up-to-date with the latest API and should continue to work as expected.
