Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide executable code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor code to replace the deprecated method `javax.swing.FocusManager.disableSwingFocusManager()` with the recommended alternative:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
FocusManager.disableSwingFocusManager();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager().setDefaultFocusTraversalPolicy(new MyFocusTraversalPolicy());
```

In the above example, we are replacing the `disableSwingFocusManager()` method with `setDefaultFocusTraversalPolicy()`. We are also using the `getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager()` method to obtain the `KeyboardFocusManager` instance, which allows us to set the focus traversal policy using the recommended approach. In this case, we are setting a custom `FocusTraversalPolicy` called `MyFocusTraversalPolicy`.
