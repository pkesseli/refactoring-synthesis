Assuming that we have an instance of the FocusManager called "focusManager", here is an executable refactoring example:

<<< Before refactoring:
boolean isFocusEnabled = focusManager.isFocusManagerEnabled();

>>> After refactoring:
KeyboardFocusManager kfm = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager();
FocusTraversalPolicy policy = kfm.getDefaultFocusTraversalPolicy();
boolean isFocusEnabled = policy.getImplicitDownCycleTraversal(); 

Note: The replacement method returns a FocusTraversalPolicy, which can be used to retrieve various properties related to focus management. In this example, we retrieve the implicit down-cycle traversal property to get the same result as the deprecated method.
