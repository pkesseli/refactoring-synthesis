The method javax.swing.InputVerifier.shouldYieldFocusâ€‹(JComponent) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "use InputVerifier.shouldYieldFocus(JComponent, JComponent)
 instead."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
