Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the use of `javax.swing.JComponent.disable()` to `java.awt.Component.setEnabled(false)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.disable();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.setEnabled(false);
``` 

In this example, we have replaced the deprecated `disable()` method of `JButton` with the `setEnabled(false)` method of `Component`. This will have the same effect of disabling the button, but now uses the recommended method instead of the deprecated one.
