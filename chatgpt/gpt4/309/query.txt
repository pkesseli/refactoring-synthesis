The method javax.swing.JComponent.enable() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by java.awt.Component.setEnabled(boolean)."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
