<<< Before refactoring:
```
public void mouseDown(Event evt, int x, int y) {
   // Handle mouse down event
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
@Override
public void processMouseEvent(MouseEvent evt) {
    super.processMouseEvent(evt);
    if (evt.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_PRESSED) {
        // Handle mouse down event
    }
}
```

Explanation:
The `java.awt.Component.mouseDown(Event, int, int)` method is deprecated and has been replaced by `java.awt.Component.processMouseEvent(MouseEvent)`. Therefore, in the refactored code, we override `processMouseEvent()` method instead of `mouseDown()` method to handle mouse down events. We also check the event ID to make sure that it's a mouse press event before handling it.
