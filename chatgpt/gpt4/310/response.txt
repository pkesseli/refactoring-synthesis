As an AI language model, I do not have access to the codebase or development environment to provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide a code snippet that demonstrates the recommended way to replace the deprecated method javax.swing.JComponent.getNextFocusableComponent():

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JComponent component = new JComponent();
JComponent nextComponent = component.getNextFocusableComponent();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JComponent component = new JComponent();
FocusTraversalPolicy policy = component.getFocusTraversalPolicy();
JComponent nextComponent = policy.getComponentAfter(component.getParent(), component);
``` 

In the refactored code, we first get the focus traversal policy of the component, and then use the policy to obtain the next focusable component. This approach conforms to the recommended replacement for the deprecated method.
