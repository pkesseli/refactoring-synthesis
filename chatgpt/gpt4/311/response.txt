I'm sorry, but I cannot provide executable code examples as I don't have the context or the specific use case for the code. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor the deprecated `javax.swing.JComponent.hide()` method based on its Javadoc comment.

According to the Javadoc, the `hide()` method is deprecated because "as of JDK version 1.5, replaced by setVisible(false)". Therefore, a refactoring example to replace `hide()` with `setVisible(false)` would look like:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JComponent myComponent = new JComponent();
myComponent.hide();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JComponent myComponent = new JComponent();
myComponent.setVisible(false);
``` 

In this example, the `hide()` method call on the `myComponent` instance is replaced with `setVisible(false)`, which will achieve the same effect of hiding the component.
