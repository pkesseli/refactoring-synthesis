The method javax.swing.JComponent.isManagingFocus() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of 1.4, replaced by
   Component.setFocusTraversalKeys(int, Set) and
   Container.setFocusCycleRoot(boolean)."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
