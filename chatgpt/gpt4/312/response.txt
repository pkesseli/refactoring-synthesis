Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot create an executable example for you as I do not have access to a specific codebase. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `isManagingFocus()` method in a general sense. 

Assuming that the code in question is using `isManagingFocus()` to check whether a component is responsible for managing its own focus, the following refactoring can be done:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
JComponent myComponent = new JPanel();
if (myComponent.isManagingFocus()) {
    // do something
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
JComponent myComponent = new JPanel();
if (myComponent.isFocusCycleRoot()) {
    // do something
}
```

In this refactored code, we replace the use of the deprecated `isManagingFocus()` method with `isFocusCycleRoot()`. This method returns `true` if the component is the root of a focus traversal cycle, which is equivalent to being responsible for managing its own focus. 

Alternatively, if you want to handle focus traversal keys instead of checking whether a component manages focus, you can refactor the code as follows:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
JComponent myComponent = new JPanel();
Set<AWTKeyStroke> forwardKeys = myComponent.getFocusTraversalKeys(
        KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS);
if (forwardKeys.contains(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_TAB, 0))) {
    // do something
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
JComponent myComponent = new JPanel();
myComponent.setFocusTraversalKeys(KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS, 
        Collections.singleton(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_TAB, 0)));
```

In this refactored code, we replace the use of `getFocusTraversalKeys()` and `contains()` with `setFocusTraversalKeys()` to set the forward traversal keys for the component. We pass a `Set` containing the desired key as a parameter to `setFocusTraversalKeys()`.
