As an AI language model, I don't have access to your specific codebase or environment. However, I can provide an example refactoring in general terms:

Assuming you have a Java Swing component called "myComponent" and you're using the deprecated method `requestDefaultFocus()` to give it focus, you can refactor your code as follows:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```
myComponent.requestDefaultFocus();
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```
FocusTraversalPolicy policy = myComponent.getFocusTraversalPolicy();
Component newFocus = policy.getDefaultComponent(myComponent);
newFocus.requestFocus();
```

This code first retrieves the `FocusTraversalPolicy` object associated with `myComponent`. It then uses the `getDefaultComponent()` method to get the default component to focus on. Finally, it calls `requestFocus()` on the new component to give it focus.
