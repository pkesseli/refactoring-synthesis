I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your specific codebase and environment, so I can't provide an executable refactoring example for you. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor your code to use the new FocusTraversalPolicy class instead of the deprecated setNextFocusableComponent method:

1. Create a new instance of FocusTraversalPolicy, which determines the order in which components receive focus.
2. Set the focus traversal policy for the container that contains the components you want to set focus traversal for.
3. Implement the getComponentAfter and getComponentBefore methods in your FocusTraversalPolicy instance to determine the order in which components should receive focus.

Here is an example of how you might refactor your code to use FocusTraversalPolicy:

<<< Before refactoring:

```
JButton button1 = new JButton("Button 1");
JButton button2 = new JButton("Button 2");
JButton button3 = new JButton("Button 3");

button1.setNextFocusableComponent(button2);
button2.setNextFocusableComponent(button3);
button3.setNextFocusableComponent(button1);
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
JButton button1 = new JButton("Button 1");
JButton button2 = new JButton("Button 2");
JButton button3 = new JButton("Button 3");

FocusTraversalPolicy policy = new MyFocusTraversalPolicy(button1, button2, button3);
container.setFocusTraversalPolicy(policy);

...

private class MyFocusTraversalPolicy extends FocusTraversalPolicy {
    private Component[] components;

    public MyFocusTraversalPolicy(Component... components) {
        this.components = components;
    }

    public Component getComponentAfter(Container focusCycleRoot, Component component) {
        int index = (Arrays.asList(components).indexOf(component) + 1) % components.length;
        return components[index];
    }

    public Component getComponentBefore(Container focusCycleRoot, Component component) {
        int index = Arrays.asList(components).indexOf(component) - 1;
        if (index < 0) {
            index = components.length - 1;
        }
        return components[index];
    }

    public Component getDefaultComponent(Container focusCycleRoot) {
        return components[0];
    }

    public Component getLastComponent(Container focusCycleRoot) {
        return components[components.length - 1];
    }

    public Component getFirstComponent(Container focusCycleRoot) {
        return components[0];
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a custom FocusTraversalPolicy that takes an array of components as a constructor argument. We implement the getComponentAfter and getComponentBefore methods to return the next and previous components in the array, respectively, wrapping around to the beginning or end of the array as necessary. Finally, we set the focus traversal policy for the container to our custom policy.
