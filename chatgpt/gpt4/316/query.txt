The method javax.swing.JInternalFrame.getMenuBar() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of Swing version 1.0.3,
 replaced by getJMenuBar()."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
