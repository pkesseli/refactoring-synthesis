Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have access to your codebase or development environment to provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with a general refactoring guideline to replace the deprecated method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();
JMenu menu = new JMenu("File");
menuBar.add(menu);
Component component = menuBar.getComponentAtIndex(0);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();
JMenu menu = new JMenu("File");
menuBar.add(menu);
Component component = menuBar.getComponent(0);
```

In the above refactoring example, the deprecated method `getComponentAtIndex(int)` is replaced with the new method `getComponent(int i)` to retrieve the first component of the `menuBar`. This should be a straightforward change in your codebase to address the deprecation warning.
