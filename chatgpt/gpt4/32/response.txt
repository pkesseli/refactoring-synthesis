I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your specific codebase, so I can't provide an executable refactoring example for your code. However, I can give you a general example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `java.awt.Component.mouseDrag(Event, int, int)`.

Assuming you have the following code using the deprecated `mouseDrag` method:

```
public void mouseDrag(Event e, int x, int y) {
    // do something
}
```

You can refactor it to use the recommended `processMouseMotionEvent` method as follows:

```
public void processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent e) {
    if (e.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_DRAGGED) {
        int x = e.getX();
        int y = e.getY();
        // do something
    }
}
```

Here, we check if the `MouseEvent` is a `MOUSE_DRAGGED` event, which is equivalent to the deprecated `mouseDrag` method. We then extract the `x` and `y` coordinates from the `MouseEvent` and perform the necessary actions. This code should replace the old `mouseDrag` method in your codebase.
