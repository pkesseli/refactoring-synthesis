Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the use of the deprecated method `getText()` in `JPasswordField` to use the recommended method `getPassword()`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
String password = passwordField.getText();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
char[] passwordChars = passwordField.getPassword();
String password = new String(passwordChars);
```

In the refactored code, we first create a `JPasswordField` instance, just like before. However, instead of using the deprecated `getText()` method to retrieve the password as a `String`, we use the recommended `getPassword()` method, which returns an array of `char`. We then convert this array of `char` to a `String` using its constructor. This is because many libraries and APIs expect a password to be provided as a `String`, not a `char` array.
