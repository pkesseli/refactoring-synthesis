Sure, here is an executable refactoring example as per your requirements:

Before refactoring:
```
JPopupMenu popupMenu = new JPopupMenu();
Component component = popupMenu.getComponentAtIndex(0);
```

After refactoring:
```
JPopupMenu popupMenu = new JPopupMenu();
Component component = popupMenu.getComponent(0);
```

Explanation:
The `getComponentAtIndex` method in `JPopupMenu` class is deprecated and should be replaced with `getComponent` method from its parent class `Container`. So, the refactored code replaces the deprecated method with its suggested replacement.
