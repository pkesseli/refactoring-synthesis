The method javax.swing.JViewport.isBackingStoreEnabled() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "As of Java 2 platform v1.3, replaced by
             getScrollMode()."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
