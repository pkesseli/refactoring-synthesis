I'm sorry, but as a language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example as it would require access to a specific codebase and its dependencies. However, I can give you a general example of how to refactor the deprecated method call to the recommended one.

Assuming you have a JViewport object named viewport, you can replace a call to the deprecated method isBackingStoreEnabled() with a call to getScrollMode() like this:

Before refactoring:
```
if (viewport.isBackingStoreEnabled()) {
    // do something
}
```

After refactoring:
```
if (viewport.getScrollMode() == JViewport.BACKINGSTORE_SCROLL_MODE) {
    // do something
}
```

In this example, the condition checks if the viewport's scroll mode is set to backing store mode using the constant value JViewport.BACKINGSTORE_SCROLL_MODE, which is equivalent to the previous call to isBackingStoreEnabled().
