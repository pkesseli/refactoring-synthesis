Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `setBackingStoreEnabled()` method in `JViewport`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JViewport viewport = new JViewport();
viewport.setBackingStoreEnabled(true);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JViewport viewport = new JViewport();
viewport.setScrollMode(JViewport.BACKINGSTORE_SCROLL_MODE);
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the use of the `setBackingStoreEnabled()` method with the `setScrollMode()` method, passing in the `BACKINGSTORE_SCROLL_MODE` constant to set the viewport's scroll mode to use backing store. This is the recommended replacement for the deprecated method, as indicated in the Javadoc comment.
