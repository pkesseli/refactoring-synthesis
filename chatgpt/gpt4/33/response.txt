I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your specific codebase and cannot provide an executable refactoring example without knowing your specific code context. However, I can provide general guidelines on how to refactor your code.

To refactor the deprecated `java.awt.Component.mouseEnterâ€‹(Event, int, int)` method, you can follow these steps:

1. Find all the occurrences of the deprecated method in your codebase.
2. Replace the `mouseEnter` method calls with `processMouseEvent` method calls.
3. Test your code to make sure that the new method calls work as expected.

Here's an example of how you can refactor your code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
@Override
public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {
   // deprecated method call
   mouseEnter(e, e.getX(), e.getY());
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
@Override
public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {
   // new method call
   processMouseEvent(e);
}
``` 

Note that the `processMouseEvent` method is not deprecated and is recommended to be used instead of `mouseEnter` method.
