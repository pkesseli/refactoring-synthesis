I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot perform executable refactoring examples as I do not have access to a programming environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to address the deprecation warning in your code.

Before refactoring:
```
JPanel panel1 = new JPanel();
JPanel panel2 = new JPanel();
JSplitPane splitPane = new JSplitPane(JSplitPane.HORIZONTAL_SPLIT, panel1, panel2);
splitPane.setDividerLocation(200);
splitPane.setOneTouchExpandable(true);
splitPane.setResizeWeight(0.5);

// Add keyboard listener
splitPane.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
    @Override
    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_DOWN || e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT) {
            // do something
        }
    }
});
```

After refactoring:
```
JPanel panel1 = new JPanel();
JPanel panel2 = new JPanel();
JSplitPane splitPane = new JSplitPane(JSplitPane.HORIZONTAL_SPLIT, panel1, panel2);
splitPane.setDividerLocation(200);
splitPane.setOneTouchExpandable(true);
splitPane.setResizeWeight(0.5);

// Add keyboard listener
Action downRightAction = new AbstractAction() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        // do something
    }
};
splitPane.getInputMap(JComponent.WHEN_ANCESTOR_OF_FOCUSED_COMPONENT)
        .put(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_DOWN, 0), "downAction");
splitPane.getInputMap(JComponent.WHEN_ANCESTOR_OF_FOCUSED_COMPONENT)
        .put(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT, 0), "rightAction");
splitPane.getActionMap().put("downAction", downRightAction);
splitPane.getActionMap().put("rightAction", downRightAction);
```

In this example, the deprecated `createKeyboardDownRightListener()` method is replaced by the `Action` class to define the behavior of the keyboard events. The `getInputMap()` and `getActionMap()` methods are used to map the `KeyEvent`s to the `Action` object. This approach is more flexible and allows for more complex keyboard event handling.
