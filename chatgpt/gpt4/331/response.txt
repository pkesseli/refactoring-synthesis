I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to your codebase, and therefore cannot provide an executable refactoring example tailored to your specific code. However, I can give you a general example of how to refactor the deprecated method call:

Before refactoring: 

```java
JSplitPane splitPane = new JSplitPane();
splitPane.setOrientation(JSplitPane.VERTICAL_SPLIT);
splitPane.setDividerLocation(0.5);
splitPane.setContinuousLayout(true);
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = (BasicSplitPaneUI) splitPane.getUI();
splitPaneUI.createKeyboardEndListener();
```

After refactoring:

```java
JSplitPane splitPane = new JSplitPane();
splitPane.setOrientation(JSplitPane.VERTICAL_SPLIT);
splitPane.setDividerLocation(0.5);
splitPane.setContinuousLayout(true);
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = (BasicSplitPaneUI) splitPane.getUI();
splitPane.removeKeyListener(splitPaneUI.getKeyboardEndListener());
``` 

Here, we are removing the usage of the deprecated method `createKeyboardEndListener()` and replacing it with `removeKeyListener()` method call, which removes the key listener added by `getKeyboardEndListener()`. This should help address the deprecation warning and ensure that the code remains compatible with newer versions of Java.
