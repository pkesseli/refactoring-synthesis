Sorry, as a language model, I am not able to provide you with executable refactoring examples for a specific programming language. However, I can give you some general guidance on how to approach refactoring code when encountering deprecated methods.

When a method is deprecated, it means that it is no longer recommended to use it, and it may be removed in a future version. To address this issue, you should look for an alternative method that provides the same or similar functionality. 

Here are some general steps you can take to refactor code that uses a deprecated method:

1. Look for the replacement method in the API documentation. The deprecated method may have a note indicating the recommended replacement method.
2. If no direct replacement method is available, look for alternative methods or classes that provide similar functionality.
3. Update the code to use the new method or class.
4. Test the code thoroughly to ensure that the refactoring did not introduce any regressions.

As an example, let's say you have the following code that uses the deprecated method `createKeyboardResizeToggleListener()` in a `BasicSplitPaneUI` class:

<<< Before refactoring: 
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.getDivider().addKeyListener(splitPaneUI.createKeyboardResizeToggleListener());

To refactor this code, you can replace the deprecated method with a new method that provides the same functionality. In this case, you can use the `createToggleKeyHandler()` method:

>>> After refactoring:
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.getDivider().addKeyListener(splitPaneUI.createToggleKeyHandler());

Note that this is just an example, and you should always consult the API documentation for the specific method you are trying to replace.
