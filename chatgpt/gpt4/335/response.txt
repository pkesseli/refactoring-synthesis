I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your project's codebase or IDE. However, I can give you a general example of how you can refactor this deprecated method:

Assuming you have a split pane component and you want to set the border on the divider, you can do the following refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
int dividerBorderSize = splitPane.getUI().getDividerBorderSize();

>>> After refactoring:
Border dividerBorder = BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(0, 0, 0, 0);
splitPane.setDividerSize(dividerBorder.getBorderInsets(splitPane).getHeight());
splitPane.setDividerBorder(dividerBorder);

This code snippet creates an empty border with zero padding and sets it as the divider border for the split pane. It then sets the divider size based on the height of the divider border. This is a cleaner and more up-to-date way of achieving the same functionality without using the deprecated method.
