Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecation of the `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI.modelToView` method:

Assuming we have the following code snippet:

```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
int pos = 5;
Position.Bias bias = Position.Bias.Forward;
Rectangle rectangle = basicTextUI.modelToView(textComponent, pos, bias);
```

Before refactoring:

```
// Deprecated method call
Rectangle rectangle = basicTextUI.modelToView(textComponent, pos, bias);
```

After refactoring:

```
// Updated method call
Shape shape = textUI.modelToView2D(textComponent, pos, bias);
Rectangle rectangle = (shape instanceof Rectangle) ? (Rectangle) shape : shape.getBounds();
```

Explanation:
- We replace the deprecated `modelToView` method call with the updated `modelToView2D` method call.
- The `modelToView2D` method returns a `Shape` object instead of a `Rectangle`. Therefore, we need to store the result in a `Shape` object first and then cast it to a `Rectangle`.
- If the `Shape` object is not a `Rectangle`, we use its `getBounds()` method to get the bounding rectangle.
