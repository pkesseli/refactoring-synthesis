The method javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI.viewToModel​(JTextComponent, Point) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     TextUI.viewToModel2D(JTextComponent, Point2D, Position.Bias[])"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
