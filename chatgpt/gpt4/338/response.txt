Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to execute or generate code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI.viewToModel​(JTextComponent, Point)` using the recommended replacement method `TextUI.viewToModel2D(JTextComponent, Point2D, Position.Bias[])`.

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point point = new Point(10, 20);
int modelIndex = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel(textComponent, point);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point2D point2D = new Point2D.Double(10, 20);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int modelIndex = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel2D(textComponent, point2D, bias);
```
In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated method `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI.viewToModel​(JTextComponent, Point)` with the recommended replacement method `TextUI.viewToModel2D(JTextComponent, Point2D, Position.Bias[])`. We created a new `Point2D` object with the same x and y coordinates as the old `Point` object. We also created a new `Position.Bias` array and passed it as a parameter to the new method. Finally, we used the new method to get the model index from the view coordinates.
