I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your codebase, so I cannot provide you with an executable refactoring example. However, I can give you a general idea of how you can refactor your code to use the non-deprecated method. 

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.swing.text.JTextComponent;
import javax.swing.text.Position;

public class TextComponentHelper {
    public int viewToModel(JTextComponent textComponent, Point point, Position.Bias[] bias) {
        return textComponent.getUI().viewToModel(textComponent, point, bias);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Point;
import java.awt.geom.Point2D;
import javax.swing.text.JTextComponent;
import javax.swing.text.Position;
import javax.swing.plaf.TextUI;

public class TextComponentHelper {
    public int viewToModel(JTextComponent textComponent, Point point, Position.Bias[] bias) {
        TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
        Point2D point2D = new Point2D.Float(point.x, point.y);
        return textUI.viewToModel2D(textComponent, point2D, bias);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `viewToModel` method with the non-deprecated `viewToModel2D` method. We have also added an import statement for `java.awt.geom.Point2D` and `javax.swing.plaf.TextUI`. We have modified the `viewToModel` method to create a `Point2D` object from the `Point` object passed in, and then called `viewToModel2D` with the new `Point2D` object.
