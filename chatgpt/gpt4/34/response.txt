I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase and I cannot refactor your code for you. However, I can give you a general example of how to refactor your code to replace the deprecated `mouseExit` method with `processMouseEvent` method.

Assuming you have a `MyComponent` class that extends `java.awt.Component` and currently uses the deprecated `mouseExit` method, here's an example of how you can refactor the code:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;
import java.awt.event.MouseListener;

public class MyComponent extends Component implements MouseListener {
    //...

    public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {
        // deprecated method
        mouseExit(e, e.getX(), e.getY());
    }

    //...
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;
import java.awt.event.MouseListener;

public class MyComponent extends Component implements MouseListener {
    //...

    public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {
        processMouseEvent(e);
    }

    //...
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `mouseExit` method with the `processMouseEvent` method, which is the recommended replacement. The `processMouseEvent` method handles the mouse event by calling the appropriate `MouseListener` method, such as `mouseExited`, based on the current state of the component.
