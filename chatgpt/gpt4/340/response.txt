As I am an AI language model, I don't have access to your specific codebase or development environment to provide you with an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalComboBoxUI.editablePropertyChanged(PropertyChangeEvent)`.

Before refactoring:
```
MetalComboBoxUI comboBoxUI = new MetalComboBoxUI();
PropertyChangeEvent evt = new PropertyChangeEvent(this, "editable", false, true);
comboBoxUI.editablePropertyChanged(evt);
```

After refactoring:
```
JComboBox comboBox = new JComboBox();
comboBox.setEditable(true);
```

In this refactoring example, instead of directly invoking the deprecated `editablePropertyChanged` method, we create a new `JComboBox` instance and set its `editable` property to `true`. This achieves the same result as invoking the deprecated method but uses the recommended approach for editable combo boxes in more recent versions of Java.
