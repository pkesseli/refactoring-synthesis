Sure, here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
MultiTextUI multiTextUI = new MultiTextUI();
int pos = 5;
Position.Bias bias = Position.Bias.Forward;
Rectangle rect = multiTextUI.modelToView(textComponent, pos, bias);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
int pos = 5;
Position.Bias bias = Position.Bias.Forward;
Rectangle2D rect = textUI.modelToView2D(textComponent, pos, bias);
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle((int) rect2d.getX(), (int) rect2d.getY(), (int) rect2d.getWidth(), (int) rect2d.getHeight());
```

In this example, we've refactored the code to use the non-deprecated method `TextUI.modelToView2D()` instead of `MultiTextUI.modelToView()`. We've also changed the type of the `rect` variable to `Rectangle2D` to match the return type of `modelToView2D()`, and then created a new `Rectangle` object with the same dimensions as `rect2d`. This should ensure that the code works properly and won't be affected by the deprecation of `MultiTextUI.modelToView()`.
