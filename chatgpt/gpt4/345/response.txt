I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable example for you to refactor. However, I can guide you through the refactoring process.

Deprecation means that the method is no longer recommended for use, and may be removed in future releases. To refactor the code, you should replace the deprecated method with an alternative method that provides the same functionality.

In this case, the deprecated method javax.swing.plaf.multi.MultiTextUI.viewToModel(JTextComponent, Point) can be replaced with JTextComponent.viewToModel(Point).

Here's an example of how you can refactor the code:

<<< Before refactoring:

```
import javax.swing.plaf.multi.MultiTextUI;
import javax.swing.text.JTextComponent;
import java.awt.Point;

public class MyTextComponent extends JTextComponent {
    public int viewToModel(Point p) {
        MultiTextUI ui = (MultiTextUI) getUI();
        return ui.viewToModel(this, p);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
import javax.swing.text.JTextComponent;
import java.awt.Point;

public class MyTextComponent extends JTextComponent {
    public int viewToModel(Point p) {
        return super.viewToModel(p);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the deprecated method viewToModel() is replaced with JTextComponent.viewToModel(). This ensures that the code remains compatible with future releases of Java.
