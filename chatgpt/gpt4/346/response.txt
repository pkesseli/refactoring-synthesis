Sorry, as a language model, I cannot provide an executable example as it requires the installation of the specific software package and environment to execute the code. However, I can give you a general refactoring example that you can apply to your code.

Before refactoring: 

```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();
Point point = new Point(10, 20);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
textComponent.viewToModel(point, bias);
```

After refactoring: 

```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();
Point point = new Point(10, 20);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
textComponent.getUI().viewToModel(textComponent, point, bias);
```

Explanation: 

The deprecation message suggests that the `viewToModel` method in `MultiTextUI` should not be used anymore. Instead, you should use the `viewToModel` method from the UI delegate of the text component. In the refactored code, we use the `getUI()` method to get the UI delegate for the `textComponent` and call its `viewToModel` method with the same arguments as before.
