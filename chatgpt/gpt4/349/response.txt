Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated method `javax.swing.plaf.TextUI.modelToView` to use `TextUI.modelToView2D` instead:

Assuming you have the following code before refactoring:

```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
int offset = 10;
Position.Bias bias = Position.Bias.Forward;
Rectangle rectangle = textUI.modelToView(textComponent, offset, bias);
```

Here's how you can refactor the code to use the new method:

```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
int offset = 10;
Position.Bias bias = Position.Bias.Forward;
Shape shape = textUI.modelToView2D(textComponent, offset, bias);
Rectangle rectangle = (shape instanceof Rectangle) ? (Rectangle)shape : shape.getBounds();
```

Note that we're using `modelToView2D` instead of `modelToView`, and since the new method returns a `Shape` instead of a `Rectangle`, we need to do some type checking and casting to convert it to a `Rectangle` before using it in our code.
