I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or the specific context of your application. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.awt.Component.mouseMove(Event, int, int)` method.

Before refactoring:
```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void mouseMoved(Event evt, int x, int y) {
        // some code here
        super.mouseMove(evt, x, y);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent evt) {
        if (evt.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVED) {
            int x = evt.getX();
            int y = evt.getY();
            // some code here
        }
        super.processMouseMotionEvent(evt);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `mouseMove()` method has been replaced with the `processMouseMotionEvent()` method, which is recommended by the deprecation comment in the Javadoc. The `if` statement checks for the specific event ID `MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVED`, and the `getX()` and `getY()` methods are used to retrieve the x and y coordinates of the mouse cursor. The rest of the code in the `mouseMoved()` method is placed inside the `if` statement. Finally, the `super.processMouseMotionEvent()` method is called to ensure that any other necessary processing is done.
