Sure, here's an executable refactoring example for you:

Assuming we have a `JTextComponent` called `textComponent` and a `Point` called `point`, and we want to use the `viewToModel` method to get the model offset of the character at the given point in the text component:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
int offset = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel(textComponent, point);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Point2D.Float point2D = new Point2D.Float(point.x, point.y);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int offset = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel2D(textComponent, point2D, bias);
```

In the refactored code, we first convert the `Point` to a `Point2D.Float` object, which is the expected argument type for the new `viewToModel2D` method. Then we create an empty `Position.Bias` array to pass as the third argument to the method. Finally, we call `viewToModel2D` with the updated arguments and assign the returned offset to the `offset` variable.
