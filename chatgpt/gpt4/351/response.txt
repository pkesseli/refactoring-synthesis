Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have access to your codebase and cannot provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor your code to replace the deprecated method with the new one.

Assuming you have the following code using the deprecated method:

```
Point point = new Point(10, 10);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();

int modelIndex = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel(textComponent, point, bias);
```

Here's how you can refactor it using the new method:

```
Point2D point = new Point2D.Double(10, 10);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();

int modelIndex = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel2D(textComponent, point, bias);
```

Note that we changed the type of the point from `Point` to `Point2D`, and we're using the new method `viewToModel2D` instead of the deprecated `viewToModel`.
