Here is an example of a possible refactoring for the deprecation of the `javax.swing.RepaintManager.addDirtyRegion​(Applet, int, int, int, int)` method:

Before refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.RepaintManager;

public class MyCustomApplet extends Applet {
    private RepaintManager repaintManager;

    public void init() {
        repaintManager = new RepaintManager();
        // ...
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        repaintManager.addDirtyRegion(this, 0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());
        // ...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.RepaintManager;
import javax.swing.JComponent;

public class MyCustomComponent extends JComponent {
    private RepaintManager repaintManager;

    public MyCustomComponent() {
        repaintManager = new RepaintManager();
        // ...
    }

    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        repaintManager.addDirtyRegion(this, 0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());
        // ...
    }
}
```

Explanation: The `javax.swing.RepaintManager.addDirtyRegion​(Applet, int, int, int, int)` method is deprecated because the `java.applet.Applet` class is itself deprecated. Instead, it is recommended to use the newer `javax.swing.JComponent` class for creating custom components. In the refactored code, we replace the `MyCustomApplet` class with a new `MyCustomComponent` class that extends `JComponent` and overrides the `paintComponent()` method to call `super.paintComponent()` and then add a dirty region to the repaint manager.
