I'm sorry, as a language model, I don't have access to the code you're working on, so I can't provide an executable refactoring example for your specific codebase. However, I can give you a general example of how to refactor code that uses a deprecated method.

Before refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.table.TableColumn;

public class MyTableColumn extends TableColumn {
    public void someMethod() {
        disableResizedPosting(); // deprecated method
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.table.TableColumn;

public class MyTableColumn extends TableColumn {
    public void someMethod() {
        setResizingAllowed(false); // equivalent replacement
    }
}
```

In this example, the deprecated `disableResizedPosting()` method has been replaced with the `setResizingAllowed(false)` method, which has the same effect of preventing the column from being resized. The new method is not deprecated and is a recommended replacement according to the Java documentation.
