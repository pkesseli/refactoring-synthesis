As an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable example as I do not have access to a Java development environment. However, I can provide a refactoring suggestion based on the deprecation comment you provided.

Before refactoring: 

```java
TableColumn column = new TableColumn(columnIndex);
column.setResizable(true);
column.enableResizedPosting();
```

After refactoring:

```java
TableColumn column = new TableColumn(columnIndex);
column.setResizable(true);
// Instead of enableResizedPosting, use the following line to set the resize behavior
column.setResizedPostingWidth(1);
```

By replacing the deprecated `enableResizedPosting()` method with `setResizedPostingWidth(1)`, the same functionality can be achieved without using a deprecated method. This should suppress any deprecation warnings and ensure compatibility with Java 2 platform v1.3 and newer versions.
