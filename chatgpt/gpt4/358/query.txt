The method javax.swing.text.JTextComponent.modelToViewâ€‹(int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     JTextComponent.modelToView2D(int)"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
