The method javax.swing.text.JTextComponent.viewToModelâ€‹(Point) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     JTextComponent.viewToModel2D(Point2D)"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
