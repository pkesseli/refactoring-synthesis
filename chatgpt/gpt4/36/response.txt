As an AI language model, I don't have access to an IDE or development environment to perform the refactoring. However, I can provide a refactoring example in code format:

Assuming we have a custom component class named `CustomComponent` that extends the `java.awt.Component` class and uses the deprecated `mouseUp()` method. Here is an example of how to refactor the code:

<<< Before refactoring:

```
public class CustomComponent extends Component {
 
    @Override
    public void mouseUp(Event event, int x, int y) {
        // process mouse up event
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
public class CustomComponent extends Component {
 
    @Override
    public void processMouseEvent(MouseEvent event) {
        if (event.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED) {
            // process mouse up event
        }
        super.processMouseEvent(event);
    }
}
```

The code above replaces the deprecated `mouseUp()` method with the recommended `processMouseEvent()` method. It checks if the `MouseEvent` object has a `MOUSE_RELEASED` event ID, which is equivalent to a mouse up event, and then processes the event accordingly. The `super.processMouseEvent()` method is called to ensure that any remaining event processing is handled by the parent `Component` class.
