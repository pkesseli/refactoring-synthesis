The method javax.swing.text.LabelView.getFontMetrics() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "FontMetrics are not used for glyph rendering
  when running in the JDK."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
