I apologize, as an AI language model, I do not have access to your existing codebase and cannot provide executable refactoring examples without knowing the context of the code. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how to refactor code that uses deprecated methods:

1. Look for alternative methods that provide the same functionality. Check the Javadoc for the class in question to see if there are any recommended replacements for the deprecated method.

2. Modify your code to use the recommended replacement method. Make sure to update any relevant parameters or method signatures as needed.

3. If there are no recommended replacement methods, consider rewriting the code to use a different approach altogether. This may involve changing the structure of your program or using a different library or API.

4. Test your refactored code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly and doesn't introduce any new bugs.

Here's an example of how you might refactor code that uses the deprecated LabelView.getFontMetrics() method:

<<< Before refactoring:

```
LabelView view = new LabelView(element);
FontMetrics fm = view.getFontMetrics();
int textWidth = fm.stringWidth(text);
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
LabelView view = new LabelView(element);
Font font = view.getFont();
FontRenderContext frc = new FontRenderContext(null, true, true);
int textWidth = (int) font.getStringBounds(text, frc).getWidth();
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated getFontMetrics() method with Font.getStringBounds(), which provides similar functionality but is not deprecated. We also use FontRenderContext to get a more accurate measurement of the text width.
