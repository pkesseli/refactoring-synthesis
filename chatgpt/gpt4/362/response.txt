I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to the codebase and development environment necessary to provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with the steps that you can follow to refactor the deprecated method:

1. Identify all instances of the deprecated method in your codebase.
2. Replace all calls to the deprecated method with calls to the new method, PlainView.drawSelectedText(Graphics2D, float, float, int, int).
3. Make sure to update the parameters of the new method as required to match the functionality of the deprecated method.
4. Verify that the refactored code behaves as expected and does not introduce any new bugs.

Here's an example of what the refactored code may look like:

<<< Before refactoring:
passwordView.drawSelectedText(graphics, startOffset, endOffset, x, y);
passwordView.drawUnselectedText(graphics, startOffset, endOffset, x, y);

>>> After refactoring:
((Graphics2D) graphics).setComposite(AlphaComposite.getInstance(AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER, 0.5f));
textLayout.draw(graphics, x, y);
((Graphics2D) graphics).setComposite(AlphaComposite.SrcOver);
