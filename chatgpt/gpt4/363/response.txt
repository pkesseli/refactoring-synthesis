Before refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.text.*;

public class CustomPasswordView extends PasswordView {
    public CustomPasswordView(Element element) {
        super(element);
    }

    protected int drawUnselectedText(Graphics graphics, int x, int y, int p0, int p1) {
        // draw unselected text
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
import javax.swing.text.*;
import java.awt.Graphics2D;

public class CustomPasswordView extends PasswordView {
    public CustomPasswordView(Element element) {
        super(element);
    }

    protected void drawUnselectedText(Graphics2D g, float x, float y, int p0, int p1) {
        // draw unselected text
    }
}
``` 
Explanation: The deprecated `drawUnselectedText` method in the `PasswordView` class has been replaced by `drawUnselectedText(Graphics2D, float, float, int, int)` in the `PlainView` class. Therefore, in the refactored code, we need to change the parameter types and the return type of the overridden `drawUnselectedText` method to match the new method signature. We also need to import the `Graphics2D` class, since it is used as a parameter type in the new method signature.
