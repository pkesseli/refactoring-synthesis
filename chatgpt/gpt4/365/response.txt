Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable code example as I do not have access to a programming environment. However, I can provide you with a refactoring example in pseudocode:

Before refactoring:

```
// Using deprecated method drawSelectedText() in PlainView
public void draw(Graphics g, int start, int end, int x, int y) {
  if (selected) {
    g.setColor(selectedColor);
    view.drawSelectedText(g, start, end, x, y);
  } else {
    g.setColor(unselectedColor);
    view.drawUnselectedText(g, start, end, x, y);
  }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
// Using the recommended method drawSelectedText() in PlainView
public void draw(Graphics g, int start, int end, int x, int y) {
  if (selected) {
    g.setColor(selectedColor);
    ((Graphics2D) g).setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_TEXT_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_TEXT_ANTIALIAS_ON);
    view.drawSelectedText((Graphics2D) g, x, y, start, end);
  } else {
    g.setColor(unselectedColor);
    view.drawUnselectedText(g, start, end, x, y);
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, the deprecated method `drawSelectedText(Graphics, int, int, int, int)` is replaced by the recommended method `drawSelectedText(Graphics2D, float, float, int, int)`. The Graphics object is cast to Graphics2D, and antialiasing is turned on to improve the quality of text rendering. The arguments are rearranged to match the new method signature.
