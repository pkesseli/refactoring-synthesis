I apologize, as an AI language model, I cannot provide executable code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method in your code:

Assuming you have the following code block that uses the deprecated method:

```
public class MyTextView extends PlainView {
    // some code here
    protected void paintUnselectedText(Graphics g, int start, int end, int y) {
        // some code here
        drawUnselectedText(g, start, end, y);
        // some code here
    }
}
```

You can refactor it as follows:

```
public class MyTextView extends PlainView {
    // some code here
    protected void paintUnselectedText(Graphics g, int start, int end, int y) {
        // some code here
        Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;
        drawUnselectedText(g2, (float) start, (float) end, y);
        // some code here
    }
}
```

Note that in the refactored code, we convert the `Graphics` object to a `Graphics2D` object and use the replacement method `drawUnselectedText(Graphics2D, float, float, int, int)` instead of the deprecated `drawUnselectedText(Graphics, int, int, int, int)`.
