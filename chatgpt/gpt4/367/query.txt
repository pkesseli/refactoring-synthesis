The method javax.swing.text.TableView.createTableCellâ€‹(Element) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "Table cells can now be any arbitrary
 View implementation and should be produced by the
 ViewFactory rather than the table."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
