The method javax.swing.text.Utilities.drawTabbedTextâ€‹(Segment, int, int, Graphics, TabExpander, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
 Utilities.drawTabbedText(Segment, float, float, Graphics2D, TabExpander, int)"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
