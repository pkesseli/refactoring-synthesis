The method javax.swing.text.Utilities.getBreakLocationâ€‹(Segment, FontMetrics, int, int, TabExpander, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     Utilities.getBreakLocation(Segment, FontMetrics, float, float,
                              TabExpander, int)"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
