The method javax.swing.text.Utilities.getPositionAboveâ€‹(JTextComponent, int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     Utilities.getPositionAbove(JTextComponent, int, float)"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
