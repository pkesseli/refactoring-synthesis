Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the non-deprecated method `Utilities.getPositionAbove(JTextComponent, int, float)`:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
int pos = Utilities.getPositionAbove(textComponent, caretPosition, 10);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
float x = 10;
int pos = Utilities.getPositionAbove(textComponent, caretPosition, x);
``` 

In the refactored code, we simply changed the third parameter from an integer to a float, as required by the non-deprecated method. This ensures that our code is up-to-date with the latest APIs and doesn't use any deprecated methods.
