Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.text.Utilities.getPositionBelowâ€‹(JTextComponent, int, int)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
int xPos = 10;
int yPos = 20;
int offset = 5;
Point position = Utilities.getPositionBelow(textComponent, offset, xPos, yPos);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
int xPos = 10;
float yPos = 20;
int offset = 5;
Point position = Utilities.getPositionBelow(textComponent, offset, yPos);
```

Explanation: In the original code, the `getPositionBelow` method is called with the parameters `textComponent`, `offset`, `xPos`, and `yPos`. However, the method is deprecated and the Javadoc suggests using the new method `Utilities.getPositionBelow(JTextComponent, int, float)` instead, which takes a `float` value for the `y` position instead of an `int`. Therefore, to refactor the code, we simply replace the `int` value of `yPos` with a `float` value, and remove the `xPos` parameter since it is no longer needed.
