Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot access or modify the code directly on your machine or a specific project. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `javax.swing.text.View.modelToView(int, Shape)`.

Before refactoring:
```
int pos = 5;
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10);
Shape shape = view.modelToView(pos, rect);
```

After refactoring:
```
int pos = 5;
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10);
Shape shape = view.modelToView2D(pos).getBounds2D();
``` 

In this refactored code, the deprecated method `modelToView(int, Shape)` is replaced with `modelToView2D(int).getBounds2D()`. This change is because the `modelToView2D` method returns a `Rectangle2D` object, which has the same functionality as the deprecated method. Then, we call `getBounds2D()` to obtain a `Rectangle` object from the `Rectangle2D` object.

Note that this is just an example of how to refactor the code. The specific changes needed may vary depending on the context of the code and its dependencies.
