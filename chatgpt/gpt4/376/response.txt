I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot execute refactoring examples or modify code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to address the deprecation warning related to the `javax.swing.text.View.viewToModelâ€‹(float, float, Shape)` method.

Before refactoring:
```java
import javax.swing.text.View;
import java.awt.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        View view = new View();
        Shape shape = new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100);
        int offset = view.viewToModel(50f, 50f, shape);
        System.out.println(offset);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
import javax.swing.text.View;
import java.awt.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        View view = new View();
        Shape shape = new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100);
        int offset = view.viewToModel(shape, new Point(50, 50));
        System.out.println(offset);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `viewToModel(float, float, Shape)` method with the recommended `viewToModel(Shape, Point)` method. This method takes a `Shape` object and a `Point` object as arguments, instead of two `float` values. We create a new `Point` object with the coordinates of the original `float` values to pass to the new method. This should eliminate the deprecation warning and ensure compatibility with future updates to the Java API.
