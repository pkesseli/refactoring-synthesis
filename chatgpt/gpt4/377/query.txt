The method javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView.drawLineâ€‹(int, int, Graphics, int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     WrappedPlainView.drawLine(int, int, Graphics2D, float, float)"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
