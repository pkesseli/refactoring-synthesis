The method javax.swing.text.WrappedPlainView.drawSelectedTextâ€‹(Graphics, int, int, int, int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     WrappedPlainView.drawSelectedText(Graphics2D, float, float, int, int)"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
