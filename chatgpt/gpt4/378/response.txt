Sorry, as a language model, I do not have access to your codebase or development environment. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method call:

Before refactoring:
```
WrappedPlainView view = new WrappedPlainView(document);
view.drawSelectedText(graphics, x, y, startOffset, endOffset);
```

After refactoring:
```
WrappedPlainView view = new WrappedPlainView(document);
Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) graphics;
view.drawSelectedText(g2d, (float) x, (float) y, startOffset, endOffset);
```

This refactors the deprecated `drawSelectedText` method to use the replacement method `drawSelectedText(Graphics2D, float, float, int, int)` with the appropriate arguments. Note that we need to cast the `Graphics` object to `Graphics2D` to call the replacement method.
