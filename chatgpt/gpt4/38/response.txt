I apologize, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to your codebase or development environment to provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with a general example of how to refactor your code to use the recommended method, transferFocus(), instead of the deprecated method, nextFocus():

Assuming you have a GUI component such as a JButton or a JTextField, and you want to move the focus to the next component when the user presses the "Tab" key, here's an example of how you can refactor your code:

Before refactoring:

```
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        // Move focus to the next component
        myButton.nextFocus();
    }
});
```

After refactoring:

```
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        // Move focus to the next component
        myButton.transferFocus();
    }
});
```

In this example, we replaced the deprecated method `nextFocus()` with the recommended method `transferFocus()`. This ensures that your code will work correctly with the latest version of the JDK and eliminates any potential warnings or errors.
