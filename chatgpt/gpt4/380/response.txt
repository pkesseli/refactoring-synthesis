I'm sorry, but as a language model, I am not able to provide executable code examples. However, I can suggest a refactoring approach that can help address the deprecation warning:

Before refactoring: 
```
DefaultTreeSelectionModel selectionModel = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel();
Vector<TreePath> paths = new Vector<TreePath>();
// add some paths to the vector
selectionModel.notifyPathChange(paths, new TreePath());
```

After refactoring:
```
DefaultTreeSelectionModel selectionModel = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel();
TreePath[] paths = new TreePath[3]; // or any size that suits your use case
// add some paths to the array
selectionModel.notifyPathChange(paths);
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `notifyPathChange(Vector<?>, TreePath)` method with the `notifyPathChange(TreePath[])` method. We also updated the Vector to an array and passed it directly to the new method, which simplifies the code and avoids the deprecated method call.
