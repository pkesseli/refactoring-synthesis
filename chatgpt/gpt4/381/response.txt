Sorry, as a language model, I cannot provide an executable code example as it requires access to your specific project and environment. However, I can provide a code example that shows how to refactor the deprecated method call to the new recommended method call:

Before refactoring:

```
StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);
Iterable<? extends Path> files = Arrays.asList(file.toPath());
Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject> compilationUnits = fileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromPaths(files);
```

After refactoring:

```
StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);
Collection<? extends JavaFileObject> compilationUnits = fileManager.getJavaFileObjects(file);
``` 

Note that we replaced the deprecated method `getJavaFileObjectsFromPaths` with the recommended method `getJavaFileObjects`, passing a `Collection` of `Path`s instead of an `Iterable`.
