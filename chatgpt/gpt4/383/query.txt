The method javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory.newInstanceâ€‹(String, ClassLoader) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has been deprecated to maintain API consistency.
              All newInstance methods have been replaced with corresponding
              newFactory methods. The replacement XMLEventFactory.newFactory(java.lang.String, java.lang.ClassLoader)
              method defines no changes in behavior."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
