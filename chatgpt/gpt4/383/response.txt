Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory.newInstance` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
XMLEventFactory eventFactory = XMLEventFactory.newInstance("default");
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
XMLEventFactory eventFactory = XMLEventFactory.newFactory().newInstance();
```

In the refactored code, we use the `newFactory()` method to get an instance of `XMLEventFactory` and then call `newInstance()` on that instance to create a new event factory. This is the recommended approach for creating an `XMLEventFactory` instance and avoids using the deprecated `newInstance` method.
