Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable code example as I cannot access local development environments or manipulate files. However, I can provide a code example to illustrate how to use the recommended replacement method.

Before refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void doSomething() {
        // ...
        Dimension preferredSize = preferredSize();
        // ...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void doSomething() {
        // ...
        Dimension preferredSize = getPreferredSize();
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the `deprecated` method `preferredSize()` with the recommended replacement method `getPreferredSize()`.
