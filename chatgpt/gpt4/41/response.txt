Sure, here's an example refactoring code snippet in Java:

<<< Before refactoring:
```java
public void reshape(int x, int y, int width, int height) {
  super.reshape(x, y, width, height);
  // additional logic here
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```java
public void setBounds(int x, int y, int width, int height) {
  super.setBounds(x, y, width, height);
  // additional logic here
}
```

Note that in the `reshape()` method, we're calling the `super.reshape()` method with the same parameters, and this method has been deprecated in Java 1.1. Instead, we can use the `setBounds()` method to achieve the same functionality, which is not deprecated. The rest of the code can remain the same.
