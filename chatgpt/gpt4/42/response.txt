Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example as I do not have access to a Java development environment or the codebase you are working on. However, I can provide a theoretical refactoring example in the requested format:

<<< Before refactoring: 

```java
Component component = new Component();
component.resize(500, 500);
```

>>>
After refactoring:

```java
Component component = new Component();
component.setSize(500, 500);
```

In this example, the deprecated `resize(int, int)` method is replaced with the recommended `setSize(int, int)` method. This ensures that the code remains up-to-date with current best practices and will not break in future updates to the Java API.
