Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `resize` method in Java's `Component` class:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void resizeComponent(Dimension dimension) {
        resize(dimension);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void resizeComponent(Dimension dimension) {
        setSize(dimension);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the deprecated `resize` method has been replaced with the recommended `setSize` method. This ensures that the code remains up-to-date and compatible with the latest versions of Java, and avoids any potential issues that may arise from using deprecated methods.
