I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your existing codebase, so I cannot provide an executable refactoring example without any context. However, I can provide a general example for how to replace the deprecated `show()` method with the `setVisible(boolean)` method:

<<< Before refactoring: 
```java
someComponent.show();
```

>>> After refactoring: 
```java
someComponent.setVisible(true); //to show
```
or
```java
someComponent.setVisible(false); //to hide
``` 
Note: If the `show()` method was called with `false` as an argument, then it should be replaced with `setVisible(false)`.
