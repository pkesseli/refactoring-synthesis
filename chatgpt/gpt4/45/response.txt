Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to perform an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `show()` method to use the recommended `setVisible()` method instead:

Assuming you have the following code:

```
// Before refactoring
myComponent.show(true);
```

You could refactor it as follows:

```
// After refactoring
myComponent.setVisible(true);
```

This will achieve the same result as the original code, but without using the deprecated `show()` method.
