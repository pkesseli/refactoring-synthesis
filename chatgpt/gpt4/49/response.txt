I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your code or the context in which the `java.awt.Container.deliverEvent(Event)` method is being used. However, I can provide you with an example of how you could refactor the use of this method based on the deprecation comment in the Javadoc:

<<< Before refactoring: 

```
myContainer.deliverEvent(myEvent);
```

>>> After refactoring:

```
myContainer.dispatchEvent(myEvent);
``` 

Note that the `dispatchEvent(AWTEvent e)` method is the recommended replacement for the deprecated `deliverEvent(Event)` method in the `java.awt.Container` class. You should update your code to use the new method instead to avoid any potential issues with future updates to the Java platform.
