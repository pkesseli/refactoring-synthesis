I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have access to your code or development environment to provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can give you a general idea of how to refactor your code based on the deprecation comment you provided.

Before refactoring: 

```java
import com.sun.source.tree.CaseTree;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CaseTree caseTree = ...; // instantiate a CaseTree object
    ExpressionTree expression = caseTree.getExpression(); // get the expression of the CaseTree object
    // do something with the expression
  }
}
```

After refactoring: 

```java
import com.sun.source.tree.CaseTree;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CaseTree caseTree = ...; // instantiate a CaseTree object
    List<? extends ExpressionTree> expressions = caseTree.getExpressions(); // get a list of expressions of the CaseTree object
    ExpressionTree expression = expressions.get(0); // get the first expression of the list
    // do something with the expression
  }
}
```

Note that the `getExpressions()` method returns a list of expressions instead of a single expression, so you may need to modify your code accordingly. In the example above, I assumed that you only need the first expression in the list, but you can modify it to fit your specific use case.
