Sure! Here's an example refactoring:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.*;

public class MyFrame extends Frame {
    public MyFrame() {
        Button b1 = new Button("Button 1");
        Button b2 = new Button("Button 2");

        add(b1);
        add(b2);

        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        layout();
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.*;

public class MyFrame extends Frame {
    public MyFrame() {
        Button b1 = new Button("Button 1");
        Button b2 = new Button("Button 2");

        add(b1);
        add(b2);

        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        doLayout();
    }
}
```

In the original code, the `layout()` method is called on the container, even though it's deprecated. In the refactored code, the `doLayout()` method is used instead, as suggested in the deprecation comment. This will ensure that the container's children are laid out correctly, without using a deprecated method.
