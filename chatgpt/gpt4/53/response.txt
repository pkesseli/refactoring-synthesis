Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide executable examples as I do not have access to an IDE or compiler. However, I can provide a code snippet to demonstrate how to refactor code using the deprecated `java.awt.Container.minimumSize()` method to use the recommended `getMinimumSize()` method instead.

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Container;

public class MyComponent extends Container {
    
    @Override
    public Dimension minimumSize() {
        return new Dimension(100, 100);
    }
    
    // other methods...
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Container;

public class MyComponent extends Container {
    
    @Override
    public Dimension getMinimumSize() {
        return new Dimension(100, 100);
    }
    
    // other methods...
}
```

In the refactored code, the `minimumSize()` method has been replaced with `getMinimumSize()` as recommended in the deprecation comment.
