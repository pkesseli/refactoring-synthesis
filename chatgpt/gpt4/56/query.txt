The method java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor.normalizeMimeTypeâ€‹(String) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is never invoked by this implementation from 1.1
             onwards"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
