I apologize, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to the current codebase or environment, and I cannot execute or provide specific code examples. However, I can provide a general refactoring example that may help you address the deprecated method.

Before refactoring: 

```java
String mimeType = "text/plain";
DataFlavor flavor = new DataFlavor(mimeType);
String normalizedMimeType = flavor.normalizeMimeType(mimeType);
```

After refactoring: 

```java
String mimeType = "text/plain";
DataFlavor flavor = new DataFlavor(mimeType);
String normalizedMimeType = mimeType.toLowerCase();
```

Explanation: 

Since `DataFlavor.normalizeMimeType(String)` is deprecated and not used by the implementation from 1.1 onwards, we can safely replace it with an equivalent code that achieves the same functionality. In this case, we can use the `String.toLowerCase()` method to normalize the MIME type string to lowercase, which is what `DataFlavor.normalizeMimeType(String)` does.
