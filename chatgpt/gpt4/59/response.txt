Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Dialog.show()` method to use `setVisible(boolean)` instead:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
Dialog myDialog = new Dialog(parent, "My Dialog", true);
myDialog.show();
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
Dialog myDialog = new Dialog(parent, "My Dialog", true);
myDialog.setVisible(true);
``` 

In this refactored code, we have replaced the `show()` method with `setVisible(true)` to make use of the replacement method suggested in the deprecation comment. This will ensure that the code remains compatible with newer versions of Java that may no longer support the `show()` method.
