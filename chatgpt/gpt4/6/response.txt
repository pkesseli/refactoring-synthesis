Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide executable refactoring examples as I do not have the capability to modify or execute code. However, I can provide you with general guidelines on how to refactor your code to address the deprecation of the `java.awt.AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass​(Class<?>)` method.

Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.AWTKeyStroke;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class KeyStrokeDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<AWTKeyStroke> keyStrokes = new HashSet<>();
        keyStrokes.add(AWTKeyStroke.getAWTKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_UP, 0));
        keyStrokes.add(AWTKeyStroke.getAWTKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_DOWN, 0));

        for (AWTKeyStroke keyStroke : keyStrokes) {
            AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass(MyAWTKeyStroke.class);
            MyAWTKeyStroke myAWTKeyStroke = new MyAWTKeyStroke(keyStroke.getKeyCode(), keyStroke.getModifiers());
            System.out.println(keyStroke + " equals " + myAWTKeyStroke + ": " + keyStroke.equals(myAWTKeyStroke));
        }
    }

    static class MyAWTKeyStroke extends AWTKeyStroke {
        public MyAWTKeyStroke(int keyCode, int modifiers) {
            super(keyCode, modifiers);
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.AWTKeyStroke;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class KeyStrokeDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<AWTKeyStroke> keyStrokes = new HashSet<>();
        keyStrokes.add(AWTKeyStroke.getAWTKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_UP, 0));
        keyStrokes.add(AWTKeyStroke.getAWTKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_DOWN, 0));

        for (AWTKeyStroke keyStroke : keyStrokes) {
            MyAWTKeyStroke myAWTKeyStroke = new MyAWTKeyStroke(keyStroke.getKeyCode(), keyStroke.getModifiers());
            System.out.println(keyStroke + " equals " + myAWTKeyStroke + ": " + keyStroke.equals(myAWTKeyStroke));
        }
    }

    static class MyAWTKeyStroke extends AWTKeyStroke {
        public MyAWTKeyStroke(int keyCode, int modifiers) {
            super(keyCode, modifiers);
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
In the original code, the `AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass​(Class<?>)` method is used to register a subclass of `AWTKeyStroke` to allow instances of the subclass to be used interchangeably with instances of `AWTKeyStroke`. However, this method is now deprecated and should not be used.

To refactor the code, we simply remove the `AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass​(Class<?>)` method call and instantiate the subclass `MyAWTKeyStroke` directly. Since `MyAWTKeyStroke` is a subclass of `AWTKeyStroke`, instances of `MyAWTKeyStroke` can be used interchangeably with instances of `AWTKeyStroke`.
