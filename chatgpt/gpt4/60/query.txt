The method java.awt.event.InputEvent.getModifiers() is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "It is recommended that extended modifier keys and
             InputEvent.getModifiersEx() be used instead"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
