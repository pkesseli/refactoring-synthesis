The method java.awt.event.KeyEvent.getKeyModifiersTextâ€‹(int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "It is recommended that extended modifier keys and
             InputEvent.getModifiersExText(int) be used instead"
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
