I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your codebase or development environment to provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide you with a general example of how you can refactor your code to address the deprecation warning.

Before refactoring:
```
KeyEvent event = new KeyEvent(source, id, when, modifiers, keyCode, keyChar, keyLocation);
event.setModifiers(KeyEvent.CTRL_MASK);
```

After refactoring:
```
KeyEvent event = new KeyEvent(source, id, when, modifiers, keyCode, keyChar, keyLocation);
event.setModifiersEx(KeyEvent.CTRL_DOWN_MASK);
```

In the above example, the `setModifiers()` method is replaced with the `setModifiersEx()` method, which provides a more fine-grained way of specifying the key modifiers. The `CTRL_MASK` constant is replaced with the `CTRL_DOWN_MASK` constant, which is recommended for use instead of the deprecated `CTRL_MASK` constant. This should address the deprecation warning and ensure that your code is compatible with future versions of Java.
