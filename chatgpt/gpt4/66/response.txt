Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide an executable refactoring example for the `java.awt.Graphics.finalize()` method without any context or code. The `finalize()` method is a generic method provided by the Object class in Java and is intended to be overridden by subclasses to release resources or perform cleanup operations before the object is garbage collected. 

However, in most cases, it is not recommended to rely on `finalize()` for cleanup or resource release as it is not guaranteed to be called in a timely manner or at all. Instead, it is recommended to use try-with-resources or try-finally blocks to ensure proper cleanup of resources. 

If you have a specific code example or scenario where the `java.awt.Graphics.finalize()` method is being used, please provide it and I would be happy to provide a refactoring example.
