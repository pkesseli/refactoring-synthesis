Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `getClipRect()` method in Java's AWT Graphics class:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
  
  public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    super.paintComponent(g);
    
    // Get the clipping rectangle for the graphics context
    Rectangle clip = g.getClipRect();
    
    // Draw a rectangle using the clipping rectangle's dimensions
    g.drawRect(clip.x, clip.y, clip.width, clip.height);
  }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Graphics;
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
  
  public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    super.paintComponent(g);
    
    // Get the clipping bounds for the graphics context
    Rectangle clip = g.getClipBounds();
    
    // Draw a rectangle using the clipping bounds' dimensions
    g.drawRect(clip.x, clip.y, clip.width, clip.height);
  }
}
```

As you can see, we simply replaced `getClipRect()` with `getClipBounds()`, which achieves the same result and avoids using the deprecated method. We also added an import statement for `java.awt.Rectangle` since that class is used in the refactored code.
