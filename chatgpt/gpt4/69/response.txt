I'm sorry, but it's not possible to provide an executable refactoring example for the `java.awt.image.IndexColorModel.finalize()` method, as it is a system library method and cannot be directly modified by users. 

The deprecation warning is meant to inform developers who have created subclasses of `IndexColorModel` that they should modify their code to remove any custom `finalize()` method overrides, and instead use alternative cleanup mechanisms such as `try-with-resources` or explicit `close()` calls. 

Therefore, the appropriate action for users would be to review their codebase for any subclasses of `IndexColorModel` that contain a custom `finalize()` method override, and remove it. The finalizer will be called by the garbage collector automatically at some point in the future, and any necessary cleanup should be handled by other means.
