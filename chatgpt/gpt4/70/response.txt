Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to provide an executable example as I do not have access to an environment to execute code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor code using the deprecated method:

Before refactoring:
```
RenderContext context = new RenderContext(transform);
context.concatenateTransform(new AffineTransform(scaleX, scaleY));
```

After refactoring:
```
RenderContext context = new RenderContext(transform);
context.concatenate(new AffineTransform(scaleX, scaleY));
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated method `concatenateTransform()` with the recommended `concatenate()` method. This should result in the same behavior while also adhering to best practices.
