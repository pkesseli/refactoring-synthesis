Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot execute code. However, I can provide you with an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `countItems()` method in `java.awt.List`.

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.List;

public class MyList {
   public int countListItems(List list) {
      return list.countItems();
   }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.List;

public class MyList {
   public int countListItems(List list) {
      return list.getItemCount();
   }
}
```

In this refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `countItems()` method with the recommended `getItemCount()` method. This will ensure that the code works properly and remains compatible with future versions of the Java platform.
