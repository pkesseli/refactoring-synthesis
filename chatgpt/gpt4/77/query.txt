The method java.awt.List.delItemâ€‹(int) is deprecated.
 The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by remove(String)
             and remove(int)."
Give me an executable refactoring example in the following format:
<<< Before refactoring: <code here>
>>> After refactoring: <code here>
