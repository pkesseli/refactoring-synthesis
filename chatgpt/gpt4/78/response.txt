I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your specific codebase, so I cannot provide you with an executable refactoring example. However, I can suggest a possible approach for refactoring the deprecated method java.awt.List.delItems(int, int) in your codebase.

Before refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.List;

public class MyClass {
   public void removeItems(List list, int start, int end) {
       list.delItems(start, end); // deprecated method
   }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.List;

public class MyClass {
   public void removeItems(List list, int start, int end) {
       int[] indices = new int[end - start + 1];
       for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
           indices[i - start] = i;
       }
       list.select(indices); // equivalent replacement
   }
}
```

In this example, the deprecated method is replaced with the equivalent method List.select(int[]). This new method selects the items in the list specified by the given array of indices. The refactored code calculates the array of indices to select the same range of items as the original delItems() method. This refactoring avoids the use of deprecated methods and ensures that the code will work with future versions of Java.
