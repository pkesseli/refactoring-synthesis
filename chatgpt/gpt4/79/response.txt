Sure, here's an example:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
java.awt.List myList = new java.awt.List();
int index = 0;
if (myList.isSelected(index)) {
   // Do something
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
java.awt.List myList = new java.awt.List();
int index = 0;
if (myList.isIndexSelected(index)) {
   // Do something
}
``` 

In the refactored code, the deprecated `isSelected(int)` method has been replaced with the recommended `isIndexSelected(int)` method. This ensures that the code is up-to-date with the latest Java standards and best practices.
