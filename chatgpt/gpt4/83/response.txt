I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an executable example as I do not have a development environment to execute code. However, I can provide you with a code snippet that shows the refactoring from using the deprecated `java.awt.List.preferredSize(int)` method to the recommended `getPreferredSize(int)` method:

Before refactoring:
```java
List list = new List();
Dimension preferredSize = list.preferredSize(100);
```

After refactoring:
```java
List list = new List();
Dimension preferredSize = list.getPreferredSize(100);
``` 

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated method `preferredSize(int)` with the recommended method `getPreferredSize(int)`.
