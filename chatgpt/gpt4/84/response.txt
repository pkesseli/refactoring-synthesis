Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to execute code or provide an IDE environment to perform refactoring. However, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.List.setMultipleSelections(boolean)` using `setMultipleMode(boolean)`:

Before refactoring:
```java
List myList = new List();
myList.setMultipleSelections(true);
```

After refactoring:
```java
List myList = new List();
myList.setMultipleMode(true);
``` 

Please note that this is just an example, and the actual refactoring process may vary depending on the context of your code.
