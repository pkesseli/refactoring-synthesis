Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the usage of the deprecated `java.awt.MenuBar.countMenus()` method:

<<< Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Menu;
import java.awt.MenuBar;

public class MyMenuBar extends MenuBar {
    
    public int getMenuCount() {
        return countMenus(); // using the deprecated method
    }
    
    // other methods here
    
}
```

>>> After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Menu;
import java.awt.MenuBar;

public class MyMenuBar extends MenuBar {
    
    @Override
    public int getMenuCount() {
        return super.getMenuCount(); // using the replacement method
    }
    
    // other methods here
    
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the usage of the deprecated `countMenus()` method with the new `getMenuCount()` method that replaced it in JDK version 1.1. We have also added the `@Override` annotation to indicate that we are overriding a method from the parent class.
