As I am a language model and cannot modify or execute code directly, I cannot provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can provide a code snippet that demonstrates how to update the deprecated `java.awt.MenuComponent.postEvent(Event)` method to use `dispatchEvent()` instead:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
MenuComponent menuComponent = new MenuComponent();
Event event = new Event(menuComponent, 1, null);
menuComponent.postEvent(event);
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
MenuComponent menuComponent = new MenuComponent();
Event event = new Event(menuComponent, 1, null);
menuComponent.dispatchEvent(event);
``` 

By replacing `postEvent()` with `dispatchEvent()`, the code will no longer use the deprecated method and instead use the preferred method to dispatch the event.
