Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `getBoundingBox()` method of the `java.awt.Polygon` class:

<<< Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Polygon;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Polygon p = new Polygon(new int[] {0, 1, 2}, new int[] {0, 1, 0}, 3);
        java.awt.Rectangle boundingBox = p.getBoundingBox();
        System.out.println("Polygon bounding box: " + boundingBox);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Polygon;
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Polygon p = new Polygon(new int[] {0, 1, 2}, new int[] {0, 1, 0}, 3);
        Rectangle boundingBox = p.getBounds();
        System.out.println("Polygon bounding box: " + boundingBox);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `getBoundingBox()` method with the recommended replacement, `getBounds()`. We have also changed the import statement for `Rectangle` to `java.awt.Rectangle`, since it is now used instead of the deprecated `BoundingBox` class.
