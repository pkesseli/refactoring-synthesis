As an AI language model, I cannot provide executable code. However, I can provide a refactoring example for the deprecated method java.awt.PrintJob.finalize():

<<< Before refactoring:
```
public class MyPrintJob extends PrintJob {
    // override finalize method for cleanup
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        // perform cleanup here
        super.finalize();
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
public class MyPrintJob extends PrintJob {
    // use alternative cleanup mechanisms instead of finalize
    public void cleanup() {
        // perform cleanup here
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, instead of overriding the deprecated finalize() method, a new method called cleanup() is added for performing the cleanup actions. This ensures that the code is updated to use the recommended alternative cleanup mechanisms.
