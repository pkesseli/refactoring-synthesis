Sure, here's an example refactoring for the deprecated `inside` method in `java.awt.Rectangle`:

<<< Before refactoring:

```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 20, 20);
int x = 15;
int y = 15;
if (rect.inside(x, y)) {
    System.out.println("Point is inside rectangle.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Point is outside rectangle.");
}
```

>>> After refactoring:

```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 20, 20);
int x = 15;
int y = 15;
if (rect.contains(x, y)) {
    System.out.println("Point is inside rectangle.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Point is outside rectangle.");
}
```

In this refactoring, we replaced the `inside` method with the recommended `contains` method. The functionality is the same, but the code now uses the up-to-date method that is not deprecated.
