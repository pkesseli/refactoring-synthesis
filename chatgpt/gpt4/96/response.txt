Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code using the deprecated `java.awt.Rectangle.move(int, int)` method:

<<< Before refactoring:

```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100);
rect.move(20, 20);
```

>>> After refactoring:

```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100);
rect.setLocation(30, 30);
```

In the refactored code, the `move` method has been replaced with `setLocation` to achieve the same result. The `setLocation` method is recommended over the deprecated `move` method since it explicitly sets the new position of the rectangle rather than just moving it by a relative distance.
