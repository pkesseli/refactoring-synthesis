I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I do not have access to your code or development environment to provide an executable refactoring example. However, I can explain how you can refactor your code based on the deprecation message you mentioned.

The deprecation message suggests that you should replace the use of the `java.awt.Rectangle.reshape(int, int, int, int)` method with the `setBounds(int, int, int, int)` method. So, if you have code that looks like this:

```
// Before refactoring
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 20, 20);
rect.reshape(5, 5, 30, 30);
```

You can refactor it like this:

```
// After refactoring
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 20, 20);
rect.setBounds(5, 5, 30, 30);
```

This way, you are using the non-deprecated method `setBounds` instead of the deprecated method `reshape`.
