Sure, here's an example refactoring to replace the deprecated `resize` method with the recommended `setSize` method:

<<< Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100);
        rect.resize(50, 50);
        System.out.println(rect);
    }
}
```

>>> After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100);
        rect.setSize(50, 50);
        System.out.println(rect);
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `resize` method with the recommended `setSize` method. This should avoid any issues that may arise due to using deprecated functionality and ensure that our code remains compatible with future versions of Java.
