Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor the `java.awt.ScrollPane.layout()` method, which is deprecated and replaced by `doLayout()`:

Before:

```java
import java.awt.ScrollPane;

public class MyPanel extends ScrollPane {

    public MyPanel() {
        super();
        //...
    }

    public void someMethod() {
        //...
        layout(); // Deprecated method
        //...
    }
}
```

After:

```java
import java.awt.ScrollPane;

public class MyPanel extends ScrollPane {

    public MyPanel() {
        super();
        //...
    }

    public void someMethod() {
        //...
        doLayout(); // Use the replacement method
        //...
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we simply replaced the deprecated `layout()` method with the replacement `doLayout()` method. This is a straightforward refactoring, but it's important to keep up with changes in the language and library to ensure that your code stays up-to-date and maintainable.
