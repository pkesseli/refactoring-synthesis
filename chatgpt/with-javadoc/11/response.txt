Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.Choice.countItems()` to the recommended method `java.awt.Choice.getItemCount()`:

Before refactoring:

```java
Choice myChoice = new Choice();
// add some items to myChoice
int itemCount = myChoice.countItems();
System.out.println("Number of items in myChoice: " + itemCount);
```

After refactoring:

```java
Choice myChoice = new Choice();
// add some items to myChoice
int itemCount = myChoice.getItemCount();
System.out.println("Number of items in myChoice: " + itemCount);
```

As you can see, the only change required is to replace the deprecated method `countItems()` with the recommended method `getItemCount()`. This ensures that your code is up-to-date and compatible with the latest versions of Java.
