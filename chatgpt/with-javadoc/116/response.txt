Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor the use of `setEchoCharacter` to `setEchoChar` in Java:

Before Refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.TextField;

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        textField.setEchoCharacter('*');
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.TextField;

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        textField.setEchoChar('*');
    }
}
```

As you can see, in this simple example there is no actual refactoring required as the `setEchoCharacter` method is already using the replacement `setEchoChar` method. However, if you were using `setEchoCharacter` elsewhere in your code, you would simply need to replace it with `setEchoChar` to avoid using a deprecated method.
