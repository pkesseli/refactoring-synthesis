Sure, I can provide you with a refactoring example to replace the use of the deprecated `java.awt.color.ICC_Profile.finalize()` method. 

The `finalize()` method is a method that is automatically called by the Java Garbage Collector when an object is about to be garbage collected. The `ICC_Profile.finalize()` method is deprecated because it is no longer necessary to override the `finalize()` method for cleanup purposes.

Instead of using `finalize()`, we can use the `try-with-resources` statement, which will automatically close any resources that are opened within the statement. 

Here's an example of refactoring a code snippet that uses the deprecated `ICC_Profile.finalize()` method to use the `try-with-resources` statement instead:

Before:

```
public void foo() {
    ICC_Profile profile = ICC_Profile.getInstance("somefile.icc");
    // do some work with the profile
    // ...
    profile.finalize();
}
```

After:

```
public void foo() {
    try (ICC_Profile profile = ICC_Profile.getInstance("somefile.icc")) {
        // do some work with the profile
        // ...
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // handle exception
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we're using the `try-with-resources` statement to create an `ICC_Profile` object and automatically close it when we're done using it. This ensures that any resources associated with the `ICC_Profile` object are properly released, without the need for an explicit call to `finalize()`.
