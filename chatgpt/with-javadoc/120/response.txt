Sure! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Window.applyResourceBundle(String)` method to use the replacement `Component.applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation)` method instead:

Before Refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public MyWindow() {
        applyResourceBundle("myResourceBundle");
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public MyWindow() {
        applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(Locale.getDefault()));
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `applyResourceBundle()` method call with `applyComponentOrientation()` method call, which is the recommended replacement. We've used `ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(Locale.getDefault())` to determine the default component orientation based on the current locale. This ensures that the component's orientation is set correctly based on the user's language and regional settings.

Note that this is just a simple example, and the refactoring required for your code may be more complex depending on the specific use case.
