Sure, I can provide you with a refactoring example to replace the deprecated method `java.awt.Window.applyResourceBundleâ€‹(ResourceBundle)` with `Component.applyComponentOrientation`.

The deprecated method `applyResourceBundle` was used to apply a ResourceBundle to a Window, and it has been replaced with `applyComponentOrientation` in J2SE 1.4. The `applyComponentOrientation` method is used to set the orientation of the component based on the user's language preferences.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `applyResourceBundle` method:

```
// Deprecated method
ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyResources");
myWindow.applyResourceBundle(bundle);

// Refactored method
ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyResources");
myWindow.applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(bundle.getLocale()));
```

In the refactored code, we first get the `ResourceBundle` object as before. However, instead of calling the deprecated `applyResourceBundle` method, we call the `applyComponentOrientation` method with an argument of `ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(bundle.getLocale())`.

The `getOrientation` method takes the locale of the `ResourceBundle` and returns the appropriate orientation for that locale. We then set this orientation using `applyComponentOrientation`.

By using the `applyComponentOrientation` method instead of the deprecated `applyResourceBundle` method, we ensure that our code remains up-to-date and compatible with the latest Java versions.
