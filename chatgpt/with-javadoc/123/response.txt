Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `postEvent(Event)` method in Java's `Window` class:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyWindow extends Window {

    public void myMethod() {
        // Create an Event object
        Event myEvent = new Event(this, Event.WINDOW_CLOSING, null);
        
        // Post the event to the event queue
        postEvent(myEvent);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.WindowEvent;

public class MyWindow extends Window {

    public void myMethod() {
        // Create a WindowEvent object
        WindowEvent myEvent = new WindowEvent(this, WindowEvent.WINDOW_CLOSING);
        
        // Dispatch the event to the event queue
        dispatchEvent(myEvent);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the `Event` class has been replaced with the more specific `WindowEvent` class, which has a similar constructor to the old `Event` class. Instead of using the deprecated `postEvent(Event)` method, we now use the `dispatchEvent(AWTEvent)` method and pass in our `WindowEvent` object. This will accomplish the same thing as before, but with up-to-date code that is more in line with modern best practices.
