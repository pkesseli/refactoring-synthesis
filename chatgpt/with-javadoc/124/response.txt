Sure, here is an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `reshape()` method with the recommended `setBounds()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
Window window = new Window(parent);
window.reshape(x, y, width, height);
```

After refactoring:

```java
Window window = new Window(parent);
window.setBounds(x, y, width, height);
```

By replacing the deprecated `reshape()` method with the recommended `setBounds()` method, we ensure that our code is using the most up-to-date and stable API.
