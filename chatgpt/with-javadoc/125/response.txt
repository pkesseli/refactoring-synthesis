Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to replace the deprecated `show()` method with the recommended `setVisible(boolean)` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyWindow extends Window {

    public MyWindow(Frame owner) {
        super(owner);
        // ...
    }

    public void open() {
        // ...
        show();
    }

    // ...
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyWindow extends Window {

    public MyWindow(Frame owner) {
        super(owner);
        // ...
    }

    public void open() {
        // ...
        setVisible(true);
    }

    // ...
}
```

In the refactored code, we simply replace the `show()` method with `setVisible(true)`. This is because the `setVisible()` method can be used to both show and hide a window, depending on the boolean value passed to it. 

Note that you may need to make similar changes throughout your codebase wherever the `show()` method is used.
