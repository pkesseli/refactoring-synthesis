Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `toURL()` method:

Before refactoring:

```
File file = new File("path/to/file");
URL url = file.toURL();
```

After refactoring:

```
File file = new File("path/to/file");
URI uri = file.toURI();
URL url = uri.toURL();
```

This code creates a `File` object for a file located at "path/to/file", then uses the deprecated `toURL()` method to convert it to a `URL`. 

To refactor this code, we first use the `toURI()` method to convert the `File` object to a `URI`. Then, we call the `toURL()` method on the `URI` object to obtain a valid `URL`.

By doing this, we ensure that any characters that are illegal in URLs are properly escaped, which was not done automatically by the deprecated `toURL()` method.
