Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated method `java.io.ObjectOutputStream.PutField.write(ObjectOutput)`:

```
import java.io.*;

public class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
        ObjectOutputStream.PutField fields = out.putFields();
        fields.put("name", name);
        fields.put("age", age);
        fields.write(out);
    }
}
```

To refactor this code, we need to replace the deprecated `fields.write(out)` method with `out.writeFields()` method. Here's the refactored code:

```
import java.io.*;

public class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
        ObjectOutputStream.PutField fields = out.putFields();
        fields.put("name", name);
        fields.put("age", age);
        out.writeFields();
    }
}
```

As you can see, we've replaced the deprecated `fields.write(out)` method with the correct `out.writeFields()` method, which writes the values contained by the `PutField` object in a proper format and avoids the potential corruption of the serialization stream.
