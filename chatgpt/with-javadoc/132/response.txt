Sure! Here is an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `isJavaLetter(char)` method to use the replacement method `isJavaIdentifierStart(char)` instead:

Before refactoring:

```
char c = 'a';

if (Character.isJavaLetter(c)) {
    System.out.println(c + " is a Java letter.");
}
```

After refactoring:

```
char c = 'a';

if (Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(c)) {
    System.out.println(c + " is a Java identifier start.");
}
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated method `isJavaLetter(char)` with the replacement method `isJavaIdentifierStart(char)`, which has the same functionality. The output of the code will remain the same, but it will be using the recommended method going forward.
