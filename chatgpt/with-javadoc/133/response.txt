Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `isJavaLetterOrDigit` method to use the recommended `isJavaIdentifierPart` method instead:

Before:

```java
char c = 'a';
if (Character.isJavaLetterOrDigit(c)) {
    // do something
}
```

After:

```java
char c = 'a';
if (Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(c)) {
    // do something
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace `isJavaLetterOrDigit` with `isJavaIdentifierPart`. This is a simple refactoring that should be easy to apply throughout your codebase.
