Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `newInstance` method to use the suggested `getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()` sequence instead:

Before refactoring:

```
Class<MyClass> clazz = MyClass.class;
MyClass instance = clazz.newInstance();
```

After refactoring:

```
Class<MyClass> clazz = MyClass.class;
MyClass instance = null;
try {
    instance = clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
} catch (InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException | NoSuchMethodException | InvocationTargetException e) {
    // Handle the exception appropriately
}
```

In the refactored code, we use the `getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()` sequence instead of the deprecated `newInstance` method. We also add a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions thrown by the new sequence. This ensures that any checked exceptions are properly caught and handled at compile-time, rather than being allowed to propagate up to the caller.
