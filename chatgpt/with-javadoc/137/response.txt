Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.lang.ClassLoader.getPackage(String)` method to use the recommended `ClassLoader.getDefinedPackage(String)` method:

Before refactoring:

```
ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
Package myPackage = classLoader.getPackage("com.example.mypackage");
Annotation[] annotations = myPackage.getAnnotations();
// Use annotations as needed
```

After refactoring:

```
ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
Package myPackage = classLoader.getDefinedPackage("com.example.mypackage");
Annotation[] annotations = (myPackage != null) ? myPackage.getAnnotations() : null;
// Use annotations as needed
```

In the refactored code, we simply replace the call to the deprecated `getPackage` method with a call to `getDefinedPackage`. We also need to check that the returned `Package` object is not null before accessing its annotations, as `getDefinedPackage` returns null if the package has not been defined by the class loader.

Note that this refactoring assumes that the `getPackage` method was being used to retrieve annotations for a specific package. If the code was using the `getPackage` method for another purpose, such as checking if a package has been defined, then additional refactoring may be necessary.
