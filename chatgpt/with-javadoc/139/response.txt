Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses `finalize()` method to instead use `Cleaner` class.

Before refactoring:

```java
public class MyResource {
  // Non-heap resources
  private Connection conn;
  private Statement stmt;
  
  // ... constructor, methods, etc.
  
  @Override
  protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    try {
      stmt.close();
    } finally {
      conn.close();
    }
    super.finalize();
  }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
public class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
  // Non-heap resources
  private Connection conn;
  private Statement stmt;
  
  private static final Cleaner CLEANER = Cleaner.create();
  private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;
  
  // ... constructor, methods, etc.
  
  private void cleanUp() {
    try {
      stmt.close();
    } finally {
      conn.close();
    }
  }
  
  @Override
  public void close() throws Exception {
    cleanable.clean();
  }
  
  public MyResource() {
    // ... initialization of resources
    cleanable = CLEANER.register(this, this::cleanUp);
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've removed the `finalize()` method and instead implemented the `AutoCloseable` interface. The `cleanUp()` method is responsible for releasing resources and is called by the `Cleaner` object when the object becomes unreachable. The `close()` method is used to explicitly release the resources and is called by the user of the class. The `Cleaner` object is created statically and used to register the object for cleaning up when it becomes unreachable.

By using `Cleaner` instead of `finalize()`, we have more control over the timing and order of resource cleanup, as well as avoiding potential performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs caused by `finalize()`.
