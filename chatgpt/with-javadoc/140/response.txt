Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the usage of the deprecated `getPackage` method to use the recommended `getDefinedPackage` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
// Using the deprecated getPackage method to retrieve the package
// associated with the class named "MyClass"
Package myPackage = Package.getPackage("com.example.mypackage");
```

After refactoring:

```java
// Retrieve the package using the current class loader
ClassLoader classLoader = MyClass.class.getClassLoader();
Package myPackage = classLoader.getDefinedPackage("com.example.mypackage");
```

In the refactored code, we first retrieve the current class loader using the `getClassLoader()` method on a class within the package we want to retrieve. We then use the `getDefinedPackage` method on the class loader to retrieve the package associated with the specified package name.

This approach ensures that the correct package is retrieved even in cases where multiple class loaders delegate to each other and define classes with the same package name. By using the `getDefinedPackage` method, we can be sure that the package returned is the one defined by the current class loader.
