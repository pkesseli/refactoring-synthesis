Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `isAccessible()` method:

Before:

```
public void foo(Object object) throws Exception {
    Field field = object.getClass().getDeclaredField("fieldName");
    if (!field.isAccessible()) {
        field.setAccessible(true);
    }
    // do something with the field
}
```

After:

```
public void foo(Object object) throws Exception {
    Field field = object.getClass().getDeclaredField("fieldName");
    boolean isAccessible = AccessibleObject.setAccessible(new AccessibleObject[]{field}, true);
    if (!isAccessible) {
        throw new IllegalAccessException("Unable to access field");
    }
    // do something with the field
}
```

In this refactored version, we use the `AccessibleObject.setAccessible(AccessibleObject[], boolean)` method instead of `isAccessible()`. We pass in an array of `AccessibleObject` instances (in this case, just the `field` object) and a boolean value indicating whether we want to make them accessible or not.

We also capture the return value of `setAccessible()` and check if it's `false`, which means we were unable to make the object accessible. In that case, we throw an `IllegalAccessException` to indicate that there was a problem accessing the field.
