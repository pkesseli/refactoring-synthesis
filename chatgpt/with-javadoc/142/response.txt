Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.lang.reflect.Proxy.getProxyClass()` method to use the recommended `Proxy.newProxyInstance()` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```
ClassLoader classLoader = MyClass.class.getClassLoader();
Class<?>[] interfaces = new Class[]{MyInterface.class};
Class<?> proxyClass = Proxy.getProxyClass(classLoader, interfaces);
MyInterface proxyInstance = (MyInterface) proxyClass.getConstructor(InvocationHandler.class)
    .newInstance(new MyInvocationHandler());
```

After refactoring:

```
ClassLoader classLoader = MyClass.class.getClassLoader();
Class<?>[] interfaces = new Class[]{MyInterface.class};
MyInterface proxyInstance = (MyInterface) Proxy.newProxyInstance(classLoader, interfaces,
    new MyInvocationHandler());
```

In the refactored code, we're using the `Proxy.newProxyInstance()` method instead of `Proxy.getProxyClass()` and `Constructor.newInstance()`. This new method takes the same arguments as the old method, but instead of returning a `Class` object for the proxy class, it returns an instance of the proxy class directly. This is more convenient and also avoids potential issues with accessibility in named modules.

Note that the `MyInvocationHandler` class used in the example above is just an example implementation of the `InvocationHandler` interface, which is required by the `newProxyInstance()` method to handle method invocations on the proxy object. You would need to provide your own implementation of this interface based on your specific needs.
