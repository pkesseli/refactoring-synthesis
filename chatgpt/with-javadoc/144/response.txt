Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the non-deprecated `Runtime.Version.interim()` method instead of `Runtime.Version.minor()`:

Before refactoring:

```
Runtime.Version version = Runtime.version();
int minor = version.minor();
System.out.println("Minor version: " + minor);
```

After refactoring:

```
Runtime.Version version = Runtime.version();
int interim = version.interim();
System.out.println("Interim version: " + interim);
```

As you can see, we've simply replaced the call to `minor()` with `interim()`. This should give you the same result while avoiding the use of the deprecated method.
