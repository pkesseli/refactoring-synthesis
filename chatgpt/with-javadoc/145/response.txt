Sure, here's an example refactoring that demonstrates the use of the new `Runtime.Version.update()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
Runtime.Version version = Runtime.version();
int securityLevel = version.security();
System.out.println("Security level: " + securityLevel);
```

After refactoring:

```java
Runtime.Version version = Runtime.version();
int update = version.update();
System.out.println("Update release counter: " + update);
```

As you can see, the `security()` method has been replaced with the `update()` method to reflect the changes in the version numbering scheme introduced in Java SE 10. The output message has also been updated to reflect the new information being displayed.
