Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `countStackFrames()` method:

```java
// Original code using deprecated method
Thread thread = Thread.currentThread();
int numStackFrames = thread.countStackFrames();

// Refactored code
StackTraceElement[] stackTraceElements = Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();
int numStackFrames = stackTraceElements.length;
```

In the refactored code, we're using the `getStackTrace()` method to retrieve the current thread's stack trace as an array of `StackTraceElement` objects. We can then use the `length` property of this array to determine the number of stack frames.

Note that the stack trace returned by `getStackTrace()` includes not only the current thread's stack frames, but also the stack frames of any methods that called the `getStackTrace()` method. In this example, we're assuming that we only want to count the stack frames for the current thread, so we're using `Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace()` instead of just `new Throwable().getStackTrace()`. If you want to include the calling method's stack frames, you can modify the refactored code accordingly.
