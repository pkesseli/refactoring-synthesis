Sure! Here's an example refactoring that avoids using the deprecated `Thread.resume()` method:

```java
// Deprecated code using Thread.suspend() and Thread.resume()
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    while (true) {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});
thread.start();

try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

thread.suspend(); // Deprecated method
System.out.println("Thread suspended");

try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

thread.resume(); // Deprecated method
System.out.println("Thread resumed");
```

Refactored code using a volatile boolean flag to control the thread:

```java
// Refactored code using a volatile boolean flag
volatile boolean isRunning = true;

Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    while (isRunning) {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});
thread.start();

try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

isRunning = false; // Stop the thread
System.out.println("Thread stopped");

try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

isRunning = true; // Restart the thread
System.out.println("Thread restarted");
thread.start(); // Start a new thread since the old one cannot be restarted
```

As you can see, the refactored code avoids using the deprecated `Thread.resume()` method by using a volatile boolean flag to control the thread. Instead of suspending and resuming the thread, the flag is set to `false` to stop the thread and `true` to restart it. A new thread is started to replace the old one, which cannot be restarted once it has been stopped.
