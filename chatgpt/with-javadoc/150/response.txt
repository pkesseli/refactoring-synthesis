Sure, here's an example refactoring that demonstrates how to replace the deprecated `Thread.stop()` method with a safer alternative.

Deprecated code using `Thread.stop()`:

```java
Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            // do some work
        }
    }
});
thread.start();

// stop the thread after 5 seconds
try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
thread.stop();
```

Refactored code using a shared variable to signal the thread to stop:

```java
class Worker implements Runnable {
    private volatile boolean stopRequested = false;

    public void run() {
        while (!stopRequested) {
            // do some work
        }
    }

    public void stop() {
        stopRequested = true;
    }
}

Worker worker = new Worker();
Thread thread = new Thread(worker);
thread.start();

// stop the thread after 5 seconds
try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
worker.stop();
```

In this refactored code, we create a `Worker` class that implements the `Runnable` interface and provides a `stop()` method that sets a shared `stopRequested` variable to `true`. Inside the `run()` method, we use this variable to check whether the thread should continue running or stop. 

Instead of calling `Thread.stop()`, we call `worker.stop()` to signal the thread to stop. This allows the thread to complete its current task and exit gracefully, avoiding the unsafe behavior that can result from abruptly stopping a thread.
