The method java.lang.Thread.suspend() is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has been deprecated, as it is
   inherently deadlock-prone.  If the target thread holds a lock on the
   monitor protecting a critical system resource when it is suspended, no
   thread can access this resource until the target thread is resumed. If
   the thread that would resume the target thread attempts to lock this
   monitor prior to calling resume, deadlock results.  Such
   deadlocks typically manifest themselves as "frozen" processes.
   For more information, see
   Why
   are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?."
Show me a refactoring example.
