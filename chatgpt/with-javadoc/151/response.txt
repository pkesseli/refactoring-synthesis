Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `Thread.suspend()` to avoid using the deprecated method:

Before refactoring:

```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    while (true) {
        System.out.println("Thread running...");
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    }
});

thread.start();

// Suspend the thread after 5 seconds
Thread.sleep(5000);
thread.suspend();

// Resume the thread after 5 seconds
Thread.sleep(5000);
thread.resume();
```

After refactoring:

```java
volatile boolean suspended = false;

Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    while (true) {
        synchronized (this) {
            while (suspended) {
                try {
                    wait();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Thread running...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});

thread.start();

// Suspend the thread after 5 seconds
Thread.sleep(5000);
suspended = true;

// Resume the thread after 5 seconds
Thread.sleep(5000);
suspended = false;
synchronized (thread) {
    thread.notify();
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced `Thread.suspend()` and `Thread.resume()` with a `volatile boolean` variable `suspended`. When `suspended` is `true`, the thread waits on a `wait()` call inside a `synchronized` block. When `suspended` is `false`, the thread is allowed to continue running.

To suspend the thread, we simply set `suspended` to `true`. To resume the thread, we set `suspended` to `false` and call `notify()` on the thread inside a `synchronized` block.

This code avoids the deadlock-prone behavior of `Thread.suspend()` by using a simple flag variable and `wait()`/`notify()` calls instead.
