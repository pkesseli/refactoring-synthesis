The method java.lang.ThreadGroup.allowThreadSuspensionâ€‹(boolean) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The definition of this call depends on ThreadGroup.suspend(),
             which is deprecated.  Further, the behavior of this call
             was never specified."
Show me a refactoring example.
