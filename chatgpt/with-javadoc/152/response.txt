Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `ThreadGroup.allowThreadSuspension` method:

Before:

```java
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("example");
threadGroup.allowThreadSuspension(true);

Thread thread = new Thread(threadGroup, "exampleThread") {
    public void run() {
        // Thread code here
    }
};

thread.start();
```

After:

```java
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("example");

Thread thread = new Thread(threadGroup, "exampleThread") {
    public void run() {
        // Thread code here
    }
};

threadGroup.setDaemon(true);
threadGroup.setMaxPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY);

thread.start();
```

In this refactored code, we remove the use of `ThreadGroup.allowThreadSuspension`, since it is deprecated and its behavior was never specified. Instead, we set the thread group's daemon status and maximum priority using the `setDaemon` and `setMaxPriority` methods. These methods are not deprecated and provide a well-defined way to configure the thread group.
