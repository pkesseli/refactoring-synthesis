The method java.lang.ThreadGroup.resume() is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is used solely in conjunction with
       Thread.suspend and ThreadGroup.suspend,
       both of which have been deprecated, as they are inherently
       deadlock-prone.  See Thread.suspend() for details."
Show me a refactoring example.
