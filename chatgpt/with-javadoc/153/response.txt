Sure, here's an example refactoring that addresses the deprecation of `ThreadGroup.resume()`:

Before refactoring:

```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
Thread thread1 = new Thread(group, "thread1");
Thread thread2 = new Thread(group, "thread2");

// ... code that calls Thread.suspend() on the threads ...

group.resume(); // deprecated method
```

After refactoring:

```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
Thread thread1 = new Thread(group, "thread1");
Thread thread2 = new Thread(group, "thread2");

// ... code that replaces Thread.suspend() with a non-deprecated approach ...

for (Thread thread : group.enumerate()) {
    thread.resume();
}
```

In this example, the `resume()` method of the `ThreadGroup` class has been replaced with a loop that calls `resume()` on each thread in the group. This avoids the use of the deprecated `ThreadGroup.resume()` method, which is only used in conjunction with the deprecated `Thread.suspend()` and `ThreadGroup.suspend()` methods.

Note that this refactoring assumes that the code calling `Thread.suspend()` has been replaced with a non-deprecated approach, such as using a `volatile` boolean flag to control the thread's execution. If `Thread.suspend()` is still being used, it will need to be refactored before the `ThreadGroup.resume()` method can be safely removed.
