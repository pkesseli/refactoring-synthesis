Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `ThreadGroup.stop()` method:

Deprecated code:
```
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
// ...
threadGroup.stop();
```

Refactored code:
```
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
// ...
Thread[] threads = new Thread[threadGroup.activeCount()];
threadGroup.enumerate(threads);
for (Thread thread : threads) {
    thread.interrupt();
}
```

In the refactored code, we are using the `ThreadGroup.enumerate(Thread[])` method to get an array of all the threads in the thread group. Then, we are iterating through each thread and calling the `Thread.interrupt()` method to request that the thread stop execution. This is a safer way to stop threads because it allows them to gracefully exit their execution instead of being abruptly terminated like the `Thread.stop()` and `ThreadGroup.stop()` methods did.

Note: It's important to handle the `InterruptedException` thrown by the `Thread.interrupt()` method appropriately in your code.
