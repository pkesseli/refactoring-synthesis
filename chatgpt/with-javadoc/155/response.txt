Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.lang.ThreadGroup.suspend()` method:

Before:

```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");

// Create some threads and add them to the group
Thread thread1 = new Thread(group, "thread1");
Thread thread2 = new Thread(group, "thread2");
Thread thread3 = new Thread(group, "thread3");
Thread thread4 = new Thread(group, "thread4");
// ...

// Suspend all threads in the group
group.suspend();
```

After:

```
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");

// Create some threads and add them to the group
Thread thread1 = new Thread(group, "thread1");
Thread thread2 = new Thread(group, "thread2");
Thread thread3 = new Thread(group, "thread3");
Thread thread4 = new Thread(group, "thread4");
// ...

// Suspend each thread in the group individually
Thread[] threads = new Thread[group.activeCount()];
group.enumerate(threads);
for (Thread thread : threads) {
    thread.suspend();
}
```

In this refactored code, we first create the thread group and add some threads to it as before. However, instead of using the deprecated `group.suspend()` method to suspend all threads in the group at once, we now use the `group.enumerate()` method to get an array of all the threads in the group, and then loop through the array and call `thread.suspend()` on each individual thread.

This approach avoids the deadlock issues that can arise when using `group.suspend()`, as described in the deprecation comment in the Javadoc. By suspending each thread in the group individually, we can ensure that each thread is suspended safely without causing any deadlocks.
