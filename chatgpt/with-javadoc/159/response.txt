Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `getTTL()` to use `getTimeToLive()` instead:

Before refactoring:
```java
DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket();
int ttl = socket.getTTL();
System.out.println("TTL: " + ttl);
```

After refactoring:
```java
DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket();
int ttl = socket.getTimeToLive();
System.out.println("TTL: " + ttl);
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace `getTTL()` with `getTimeToLive()`. This will ensure that the code continues to work correctly while using the recommended method instead of the deprecated one.
