The method java.net.MulticastSocket.getInterface() is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The network interface may not be uniquely identified by
             the InetAddress returned.
             Use MulticastSocket.getNetworkInterface() instead."
Show me a refactoring example.
