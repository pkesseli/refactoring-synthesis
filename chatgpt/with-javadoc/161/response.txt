Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `getInterface()` method to use the recommended `getNetworkInterface()` method instead:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class MulticastSocketExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
            MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(1234);
            NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByName("eth0");
            socket.setInterface(group, networkInterface);
            // Do something with the socket...
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, the `setInterface()` method is called with a group address and a `NetworkInterface` object. This method is now deprecated and we should use `setNetworkInterface()` instead.

Here's the refactored code that uses the recommended `setNetworkInterface()` method:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class MulticastSocketExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
            MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(1234);
            NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByName("eth0");
            socket.setNetworkInterface(networkInterface);
            socket.joinGroup(group);
            // Do something with the socket...
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we first get the `NetworkInterface` object for the interface we want to use (`eth0` in this example) and then pass it to the `setNetworkInterface()` method. We also call the `joinGroup()` method to specify the multicast group we want to join. This code should work the same way as the previous code but uses the recommended method instead of the deprecated one.
