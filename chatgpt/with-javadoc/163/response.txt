Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor your code to use the `getTimeToLive()` method instead of the deprecated `getTTL()` method in `MulticastSocket`:

Before refactoring:

```java
MulticastSocket multicastSocket = new MulticastSocket();
byte ttl = multicastSocket.getTTL();
System.out.println("TTL: " + ttl);
```

After refactoring:

```java
MulticastSocket multicastSocket = new MulticastSocket();
int timeToLive = multicastSocket.getTimeToLive();
System.out.println("Time To Live: " + timeToLive);
```

As you can see, we simply replaced the deprecated `getTTL()` method with the non-deprecated `getTimeToLive()` method, which returns an `int` instead of a `byte`. This allows us to store the value in an `int` variable instead of a `byte` variable, which may be more appropriate depending on your use case.
