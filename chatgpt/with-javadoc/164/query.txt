The method java.net.MulticastSocket.joinGroupâ€‹(InetAddress) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not accept the network interface on
             which to join the multicast group. Use
             MulticastSocket.joinGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface) instead."
Show me a refactoring example.
