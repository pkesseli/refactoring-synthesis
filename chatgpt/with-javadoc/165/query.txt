The method java.net.MulticastSocket.leaveGroupâ€‹(InetAddress) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method does not accept the network interface on which
             to leave the multicast group. Use
             MulticastSocket.leaveGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface) instead."
Show me a refactoring example.
