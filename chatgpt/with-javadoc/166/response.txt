Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor your code to use the updated method calls:

Before refactoring:

```java
MulticastSocket mcastSocket = new MulticastSocket(port);
byte[] buffer = "Hello World".getBytes();
DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length, group, port);
mcastSocket.send(packet, ttl);
```

After refactoring:

```java
MulticastSocket mcastSocket = new MulticastSocket(port);
byte[] buffer = "Hello World".getBytes();
DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length, group, port);
int oldTTL = mcastSocket.getTimeToLive();
mcastSocket.setTimeToLive(newttl);
mcastSocket.send(packet);
mcastSocket.setTimeToLive(oldTTL);
```

In this refactored code, we first create a new `MulticastSocket` instance and a `DatagramPacket` containing the data we want to send. Then we retrieve the current time-to-live value from the socket and store it in a variable `oldTTL`. After that, we set the desired time-to-live value using the `setTimeToLive` method, send the packet using the `send` method, and finally, restore the original time-to-live value using `setTimeToLive`. 

Note that you'll need to replace `newttl` with the desired new time-to-live value, and `group` and `port` with the multicast group address and port you want to use.
