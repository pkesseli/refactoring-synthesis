The method java.net.MulticastSocket.setInterfaceâ€‹(InetAddress) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "The InetAddress may not uniquely identify
             the network interface. Use
             MulticastSocket.setNetworkInterface(NetworkInterface) instead."
Show me a refactoring example.
