Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the code that uses `MulticastSocket.setInterfaceâ€‹(InetAddress)` method to use the recommended `MulticastSocket.setNetworkInterface(NetworkInterface)` method:

Before refactoring:

```
// create a multicast socket and join the group
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(1234);
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
socket.joinGroup(group);

// set the interface for sending and receiving multicast packets
InetAddress iface = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
socket.setInterface(iface);
```

After refactoring:

```
// create a multicast socket and join the group
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(1234);
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
socket.joinGroup(group);

// set the network interface for sending and receiving multicast packets
NetworkInterface ni = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(InetAddress.getLocalHost());
socket.setNetworkInterface(ni);
```

As you can see, the `setInterface()` method is replaced with `setNetworkInterface()` method, which takes a `NetworkInterface` object as its parameter. To get the `NetworkInterface` object, we use the `NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress()` method and pass in the `InetAddress` of the local host. This ensures that we are using the correct network interface for sending and receiving multicast packets.
