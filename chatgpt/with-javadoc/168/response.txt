Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `setLoopbackMode` method of `MulticastSocket` to use the recommended `setOption` method instead:

Before refactoring:
```java
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
socket.setLoopbackMode(false);
```

After refactoring:
```java
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
socket.setOption(StandardSocketOptions.IP_MULTICAST_LOOP, false);
```

In the refactored code, we use the `setOption` method with the `IP_MULTICAST_LOOP` option from the `StandardSocketOptions` enum, which replaces the deprecated `setLoopbackMode` method. The `setOption` method takes two parameters: the option to set, and the value to set it to. In this case, we pass `StandardSocketOptions.IP_MULTICAST_LOOP` as the option, and `false` as the value to disable loopback mode.

Note that in the refactored code, we don't need to specify the option's data type explicitly, since it is inferred from the type of the value we pass to `setOption`.
