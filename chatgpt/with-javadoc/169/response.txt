Sure! Here is an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `setTTL(byte)` method in `java.net.MulticastSocket` to use the `setTimeToLive(int)` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
byte ttl = 2;
socket.setTTL(ttl);
```

After refactoring:

```
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
int ttl = 2;
socket.setTimeToLive(ttl);
```

In the refactored code, we have simply replaced the deprecated method `setTTL(byte)` with the recommended method `setTimeToLive(int)`. We have also updated the variable type of `ttl` from `byte` to `int`, to match the parameter type of the new method. This code should work just as well as the original code, but with the benefit of using the recommended API method.
