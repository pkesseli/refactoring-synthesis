Since the deprecation comment in the Javadoc states that there is "no replacement" for the `java.rmi.server.LoaderHandler.getSecurityContext(ClassLoader)` method, there is no direct refactoring example to update the code using this method. However, there are a few possible ways to address the issue depending on the use case:

1. If you are using this method to obtain the current security context of the remote object, you can consider using `java.rmi.server.RemoteServer.getClientHost()` instead. This method returns the host name of the client that exported the remote object, and can be used to obtain the security context associated with the client.

2. If you are using this method to obtain the security context of a specific class loader, you can consider using a different method to obtain the security context of the current thread and pass it to the relevant method that requires a security context. For example, you can use `java.lang.Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()` to obtain the current thread's context class loader and `java.security.AccessController.getContext()` to obtain the current thread's security context.

Here is an example code snippet that shows how to use the `RemoteServer.getClientHost()` method to obtain the security context associated with the client:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteServer;
import java.security.AccessController;
import java.security.PrivilegedAction;

public class MyRemoteObjectImpl extends java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteObject {
  
  public MyRemoteObjectImpl() throws RemoteException {
    super();
  }
  
  public void doSomething() throws RemoteException {
    String clientHost = RemoteServer.getClientHost();
    SecurityContext clientSecurityContext = AccessController.doPrivileged(new GetSecurityContextAction(clientHost));
    // use the clientSecurityContext object as needed
  }
  
  private static class GetSecurityContextAction implements PrivilegedAction<SecurityContext> {
    private final String clientHost;
    
    public GetSecurityContextAction(String clientHost) {
      this.clientHost = clientHost;
    }
    
    public SecurityContext run() {
      // obtain the security context associated with the client
      // and return it as a SecurityContext object
      return null;
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the `GetSecurityContextAction` class is used to obtain the security context associated with the client in a privileged block, as required by the `java.security.AccessController.getContext()` method. This ensures that the code runs with the necessary security permissions to obtain the security context.
