Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream.getOutputStream()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyServer {
  private LogStream log = LogStream.log("myServerLog");

  public void doSomething() {
    log.getOutputStream().write("Something happened!".getBytes());
  }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyServer {
  private Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("myServerLog");

  public void doSomething() {
    OutputStream stream = logger.getParent().getHandlers()[0].getOutputStream();
    stream.write("Something happened!".getBytes());
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `getOutputStream()` method with a new way of accessing the output stream from the logger's handlers. Specifically, we're getting the first handler from the logger's parent and then getting the output stream from that handler. This assumes that there is only one handler attached to the logger, which may not always be the case.

Note that this is just one possible refactoring, and there may be other ways to replace the deprecated method depending on the specific use case.
