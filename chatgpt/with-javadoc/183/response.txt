Sure, I can give you an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream.log(String)` method.

Let's assume that you have the following code that uses the deprecated method:

```java
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyServer {
    private LogStream log;

    public MyServer() {
        log = LogStream.log();
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        log.println("Doing something");
    }
}
```

To refactor this code, you can use a logging framework such as Log4j or SLF4J instead of the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream` class. Here's an example of how you can refactor the code using Log4j:

```java
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

public class MyServer {
    private static final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(MyServer.class);

    public MyServer() {
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        log.info("Doing something");
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we use Log4j's `Logger` class instead of `java.rmi.server.LogStream`. We define a static `Logger` instance using `LogManager.getLogger()` method, passing in the class name as a parameter. We then use the `log` instance to log messages using the `info()` method.

This code is not only cleaner and more maintainable, but it also avoids using deprecated methods and follows best practices for logging.
