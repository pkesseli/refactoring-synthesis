Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.LogStream.setOutputStreamâ€‹(OutputStream)`.

Before we begin, it's worth noting that the deprecation comment "no replacement" means that there is no direct replacement for the deprecated method. However, it's still possible to refactor your code to achieve the same result using other means.

Let's assume that you have the following code:

```java
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        File file = new File("log.txt");
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
        LogStream logStream = LogStream.log("Example");
        logStream.setOutputStream(fos);
        logStream.println("This is a log message");
    }

}
```

To refactor this code, you can create a custom implementation of the `LogStream` class that writes to an `OutputStream` of your choice. Here's an example implementation:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class CustomLogStream extends LogStream {

    private OutputStream outputStream;

    public CustomLogStream(String name, OutputStream outputStream) {
        super(name);
        this.outputStream = outputStream;
    }

    @Override
    public void write(int b) throws IOException {
        outputStream.write(b);
    }

    @Override
    public void write(byte[] bytes, int off, int len) throws IOException {
        outputStream.write(bytes, off, len);
    }

    @Override
    public void flush() throws IOException {
        outputStream.flush();
    }

    @Override
    public void close() throws IOException {
        outputStream.close();
    }
}
```

This implementation extends the `LogStream` class and overrides its `write`, `flush`, and `close` methods to write to the provided `OutputStream`.

Now you can modify your code to use the custom implementation instead of the deprecated method:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        File file = new File("log.txt");
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
        CustomLogStream logStream = new CustomLogStream("Example", fos);
        logStream.println("This is a log message");
        logStream.close();
    }

}
```

As you can see, the custom implementation achieves the same result as the deprecated method without using it directly. This allows you to avoid the deprecated method and continue to use `LogStream` in your code.
