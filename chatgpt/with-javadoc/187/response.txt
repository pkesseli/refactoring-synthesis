Sure, I can give you an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream.toString()` method. 

Before we start, let's understand why the method is deprecated and what it does. According to the Javadoc, this method returns a string representation of the log stream. However, since there is no replacement for it, it is recommended to use an alternative method for logging.

In Java, there are various logging frameworks available, such as Log4j, JUL (Java Util Logging), and Logback. For this example, let's assume that we are using JUL.

Here's an example of code that uses the deprecated method:

```
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyLogger {
   private LogStream logStream;

   public MyLogger(LogStream logStream) {
       this.logStream = logStream;
   }

   public void log(String message) {
       String logString = logStream.toString();
       System.out.println(logString + " " + message);
   }
}
```

To refactor this code, we need to replace the deprecated `toString()` method with an alternative logging mechanism. Here's an updated version of the `MyLogger` class that uses the JUL logging framework:

```
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyLogger {
   private Logger logger;

   public MyLogger(String loggerName) {
       this.logger = Logger.getLogger(loggerName);
   }

   public void log(String message) {
       logger.info(message);
   }
}
```

In this updated version, we are using the `java.util.logging.Logger` class to log messages instead of `java.rmi.server.LogStream`. The constructor takes a `loggerName` argument, which is a string that represents the name of the logger. The `log` method logs a message using the `info` method of the `Logger` class.

To use the updated `MyLogger` class, we need to instantiate it with a logger name and call its `log` method with a message to be logged:

```
MyLogger logger = new MyLogger("myLogger");
logger.log("Hello World!");
```

I hope this example helps you understand how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream.toString()` method.
