Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(byte[], int, int)` method.

Suppose you have the following code:

```
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyLogger {
    private LogStream log;

    public MyLogger(LogStream log) {
        this.log = log;
    }

    public void log(String message) {
        log.write(message.getBytes(), 0, message.length());
    }
}
```

To refactor this code, you could replace the deprecated `write(byte[], int, int)` method with the non-deprecated `write(int)` method. Here's how the refactored code would look:

```
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyLogger {
    private LogStream log;

    public MyLogger(LogStream log) {
        this.log = log;
    }

    public void log(String message) {
        byte[] bytes = message.getBytes();
        for (byte b : bytes) {
            log.write(b);
        }
        log.write('\n');
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we first convert the `message` string to a byte array using the `getBytes()` method. Then, instead of using the deprecated `write(byte[], int, int)` method, we iterate over each byte in the byte array and write it to the log using the non-deprecated `write(int)` method. Finally, we write a newline character to the log to separate each log message.
