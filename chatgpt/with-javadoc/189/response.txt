When a method is deprecated and no replacement is suggested, it usually means that there is no direct alternative to the deprecated method. In this case, the method `java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(int)` is deprecated, and no replacement is suggested. However, you can refactor the code to use a different approach that achieves the same result.

One way to refactor this code is to replace the deprecated method with an alternative logging framework, such as Log4j or SLF4J. These frameworks provide a set of logging APIs that can be used to log messages with different levels of severity.

Here's an example of how to refactor the code using Log4j:

```
// Before refactoring
LogStream logStream = new LogStream(System.err);
logStream.write("Error message");

// After refactoring
Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(MyClass.class);
logger.error("Error message");
```

In the refactored code, we first create a `Logger` object using the `LogManager.getLogger` method. We pass the class name of the class where the logging statement is located as an argument to this method. This is important because it allows us to control the granularity of logging output by specifying different logging levels for different classes.

Once we have a `Logger` object, we can use its various logging methods to log messages with different levels of severity. In this example, we use the `error` method to log an error message.

Note that this is just one way to refactor the code. Depending on the specifics of your codebase and the requirements of your application, you may need to use a different logging framework or a different refactoring approach altogether.
