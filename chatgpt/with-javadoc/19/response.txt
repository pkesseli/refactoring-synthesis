Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `gotFocus` method in Java:

Before:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public MyComponent() {
        enableEvents(AWTEvent.FOCUS_EVENT_MASK);
    }

    public void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent e) {
        if (e.getID() == FocusEvent.FOCUS_GAINED) {
            // do something when component gains focus
        } else if (e.getID() == FocusEvent.FOCUS_LOST) {
            // do something when component loses focus
        }
    }

    public void gotFocus(Event evt, Object obj) {
        // do something when component gets focus
    }
}
```

After:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public MyComponent() {
        enableEvents(AWTEvent.FOCUS_EVENT_MASK);
    }

    public void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent e) {
        if (e.getID() == FocusEvent.FOCUS_GAINED) {
            // do something when component gains focus
        } else if (e.getID() == FocusEvent.FOCUS_LOST) {
            // do something when component loses focus
        }
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the `gotFocus` method has been removed, since it's deprecated and no longer recommended for use. Instead, the `processFocusEvent` method should be used to handle focus events. 

Note that if you're using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, it should give you a warning when you use the deprecated method, and you can often use an automated refactoring tool to replace the deprecated method with the recommended one.
