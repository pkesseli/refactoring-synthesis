Sure! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.Operation.getOperation()` method:

```
// Old code with deprecated method
Operation op = Operation.getOperation(in);

// Refactored code without deprecated method
String opString = (String) in.readObject();
Operation op = new Operation(opString);
```

In the refactored code, we replace the deprecated `getOperation()` method with a new approach. We first read the operation as a `String` from the input stream using `in.readObject()`, and then we create a new `Operation` object using that `String`.

Note that in this example, we assume that the `Operation` class has a constructor that takes a `String` parameter. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the `Operation` class or use a different approach to create the `Operation` object.
