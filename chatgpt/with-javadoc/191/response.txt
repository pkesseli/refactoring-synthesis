Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses `java.rmi.server.Operation.toString()` to a more modern alternative:

```
// Deprecated code:
Operation operation = ... // Some RMI operation
String operationString = operation.toString(); // Deprecated method

// Refactored code:
Operation operation = ... // Some RMI operation
String operationString = "Operation " + operation.getClass().getName();
```

In this refactored code, we're replacing the use of the deprecated `toString()` method with a custom string concatenation that includes the class name of the `Operation` object. While this code may not be as concise as the original, it avoids using a deprecated method and provides a clear and concise string representation of the `Operation` object.
