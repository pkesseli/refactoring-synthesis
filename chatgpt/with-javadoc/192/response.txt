Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that currently uses the `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.done()` method to avoid the use of the deprecated method:

Before Refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteObject;

public class MyRemoteObject extends RemoteObject {
    
    // ...

    @Override
    public void done(RemoteCall call) throws RemoteException {
        // handle completion of remote method call
        // ...
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteObject;

public class MyRemoteObject extends RemoteObject {
    
    // ...

    @Override
    public void executeCall(RemoteCall call) throws RemoteException {
        // handle remote method call
        // ...

        // call this method to indicate that the call has completed
        call.releaseInputStream();
        call.releaseOutputStream();
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the `done()` method with a new method called `executeCall()` that handles the remote method call and then releases the input and output streams to indicate that the call has completed. This new method doesn't rely on the deprecated `done()` method, and it provides a clear indication of what the method does.

Note that in some cases, it may be appropriate to leave the deprecated method in place if there is no clear replacement or if the method is still functioning correctly. However, if possible, it's generally a good idea to refactor the code to avoid using deprecated methods and to ensure that the code remains maintainable and up-to-date.
