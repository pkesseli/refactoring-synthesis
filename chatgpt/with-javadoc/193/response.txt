As the deprecation comment in Javadoc suggests, there is no direct replacement for the `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.executeCall()` method. However, if you want to refactor your code to remove this deprecated method, you can consider using the `java.rmi.server.RemoteRef.invoke(Remote, Method, Object[], long)` method instead.

Here is an example refactoring code snippet:

```
// Before refactoring:
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...; // obtain RemoteCall instance
remoteCall.executeCall();

// After refactoring:
RemoteRef remoteRef = ...; // obtain RemoteRef instance
Remote remoteObj = ...; // obtain the remote object
Method remoteMethod = ...; // obtain the remote method
Object[] remoteArgs = ...; // obtain the remote method arguments
long remoteTimeout = ...; // obtain the timeout in milliseconds
remoteRef.invoke(remoteObj, remoteMethod, remoteArgs, remoteTimeout);
```

In this example, we obtain a `RemoteRef` instance instead of a `RemoteCall` instance, and we use the `invoke` method of `RemoteRef` to invoke a remote method on a remote object. The `invoke` method takes the remote object, remote method, arguments, and timeout as parameters. Note that you will need to modify your code to obtain the necessary parameters, but this refactoring should help you replace the deprecated method.
