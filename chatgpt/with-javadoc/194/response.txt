Sure, here is an example of how you could refactor code that currently uses the deprecated `getInputStream()` method in Java RMI:

Before:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;

public class ExampleClass {
    public void doSomething(RemoteCall remoteCall) throws Exception {
        InputStream inputStream = remoteCall.getInputStream();
        // ... use the inputStream to read data ...
    }
}
```

After:

```java
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;

public class ExampleClass {
    public void doSomething(RemoteCall remoteCall) throws Exception {
        byte[] data = remoteCall.getInputStreamBytes();
        ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(data);
        // ... use the inputStream to read data ...
    }
    
    private static final int BUFFER_SIZE = 4096;
    
    // Helper method to read the entire InputStream into a byte array
    private static byte[] readFully(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
        ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        byte[] buffer = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];
        int bytesRead;
        while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
        }
        return outputStream.toByteArray();
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've added a new method called `getInputStreamBytes()` that returns the data from the `InputStream` as a byte array. This new method can be called in place of the deprecated `getInputStream()` method. 

We've also added a helper method called `readFully()` that reads the entire contents of the `InputStream` into a byte array. This is used in the `doSomething()` method to convert the `InputStream` to a `ByteArrayInputStream`.

It's worth noting that this refactoring assumes that the data being read from the `InputStream` is relatively small and can fit into memory. If you are dealing with large amounts of data, you may need to refactor the code differently to avoid running out of memory.
