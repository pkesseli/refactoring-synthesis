When a method is deprecated and has no replacement, it means that the developers have determined that the method is no longer needed and should not be used. In this case, the method `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.getResultStreamâ€‹(boolean)` has been marked as deprecated and there is no replacement for it. Therefore, it is recommended to remove this method from your code and refactor it to use an alternative solution.

Here is an example of how you can refactor your code to remove the deprecated method:

Before refactoring:

```java
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
boolean isReturnStream = ...;

InputStream resultStream = remoteCall.getResultStream(isReturnStream);
```

After refactoring:

```java
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
boolean isReturnStream = ...;

if (isReturnStream) {
    InputStream inputStream = remoteCall.getInputStream();
    // process inputStream
} else {
    Object result = remoteCall.getResult();
    // process result
}
```

In this refactored example, we are using the `getInputStream()` and `getResult()` methods of the `RemoteCall` interface instead of the deprecated `getResultStream(boolean)` method. We are also using a conditional statement to determine whether to use the input stream or the result object depending on the value of `isReturnStream`. This way, we can handle both cases without relying on the deprecated method.
