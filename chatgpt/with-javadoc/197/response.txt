Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `releaseInputStream()` method in Java RMI.

Suppose you have a client-side Java RMI implementation that uses `releaseInputStream()` to release an input stream after reading a result from a remote method call:

```java
RemoteCall call = // obtain the RemoteCall object
Object result = call.getResultStream().readObject();
call.releaseInputStream();
```

To refactor this code, you can simply remove the call to `releaseInputStream()`, since the input stream will be automatically released when the remote method call completes. So the refactored code would look like this:

```java
RemoteCall call = // obtain the RemoteCall object
Object result = call.getResultStream().readObject();
```

That's it! The `releaseInputStream()` method is no longer needed, and you can safely remove it from your code. Note that this is just one example of how you could refactor code that uses `releaseInputStream()`, and the specific details may vary depending on your particular use case. However, the basic idea is to remove the deprecated method call and let the RMI implementation handle the input stream automatically.
