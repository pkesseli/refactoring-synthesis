Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.releaseOutputStream()` method.

Suppose we have the following code that uses the deprecated method:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod(RemoteCall remoteCall, OutputStream outputStream) {
        remoteCall.releaseOutputStream();
    }
}
```

To refactor this code, we can replace the call to `releaseOutputStream()` with a call to `close()` on the `OutputStream` object, since the `releaseOutputStream()` method is used to close the output stream.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod(RemoteCall remoteCall, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
        outputStream.close();
    }
}
```

Note that we also added a `throws IOException` declaration to the method signature, since the `close()` method can throw an `IOException`.
