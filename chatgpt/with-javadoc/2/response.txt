Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `getFreePhysicalMemorySize()` method to use the recommended `getFreeMemorySize()` method instead:

```java
import com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean;
import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;

public class MemoryUsageExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OperatingSystemMXBean osBean = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMXBean(OperatingSystemMXBean.class);
        
        // Deprecated method:
        long freePhysicalMemory = osBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize();
        System.out.println("Free physical memory: " + freePhysicalMemory);

        // Recommended method:
        long freeMemory = osBean.getFreeMemorySize();
        System.out.println("Free memory: " + freeMemory);
    }
}
```

In this example, we first obtain an instance of the `OperatingSystemMXBean` using the `ManagementFactory.getPlatformMXBean()` method. We then call the deprecated `getFreePhysicalMemorySize()` method to obtain the amount of free physical memory available in bytes.

To refactor this code, we simply replace the call to the deprecated method with a call to the recommended `getFreeMemorySize()` method. This method returns the amount of free memory available (not just physical memory), so we update the output to reflect this.

After the refactoring, the output of the program should be the same, but the code is now using the recommended method and should be more future-proof.
