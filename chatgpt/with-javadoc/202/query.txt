The method java.rmi.server.RemoteStub.setRefâ€‹(RemoteStub, RemoteRef) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "No replacement.  The setRef method
 was intended for setting the remote reference of a remote
 stub. This is unnecessary, since RemoteStubs can be created
 and initialized with a remote reference through use of
 the RemoteStub(RemoteRef) constructor."
Show me a refactoring example.
