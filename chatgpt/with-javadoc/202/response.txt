Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `setRef` method in Java RMI.

Before:

```
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteStub;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteRef;

public class MyRemoteStub extends RemoteStub {
    public void setRef(RemoteRef ref) throws RemoteException {
        super.setRef(ref);
    }
}
```

After:

```
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteStub;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteRef;

public class MyRemoteStub extends RemoteStub {
    public MyRemoteStub(RemoteRef ref) {
        super(ref);
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we have removed the `setRef` method, as it is deprecated and unnecessary. Instead, we have modified the constructor of `MyRemoteStub` to take a `RemoteRef` parameter, which is used to initialize the remote reference of the `RemoteStub` object using the `super` keyword.

This way, the remote reference of the `RemoteStub` object can be set during its creation, eliminating the need for the `setRef` method.
