The method java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject.exportObjectâ€‹(Remote) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is deprecated because it supports only static stubs.
 Use exportObject(Remote, port) or
 exportObject(Remote, port, csf, ssf)
 instead."
Show me a refactoring example.
