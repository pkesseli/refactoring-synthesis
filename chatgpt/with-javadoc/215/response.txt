Sure, here's an example refactoring using the `LocalDateTime` class from the `java.time` package, which replaces the deprecated `java.sql.Date.getHours()` method:

Before refactoring:

```
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
int hours = date.getHours();
```

After refactoring:

```
java.time.LocalDateTime dateTime = java.time.LocalDateTime.now();
int hours = dateTime.getHour();
```

In this example, we create a `LocalDateTime` object using the `now()` method, which returns the current date and time. We then use the `getHour()` method to retrieve the hour component of the date and time.

Note that we use `LocalDateTime` instead of `LocalDate` because the latter class does not have a time component, and therefore cannot provide the hour of the day.

By using the `java.time` package, we are using a modern and more robust API for handling dates and times in Java. Additionally, we are avoiding the use of deprecated methods, which may become unsupported in future versions of Java.
