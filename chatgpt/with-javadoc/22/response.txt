Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the `inside(int x, int y)` method call to use `contains(int x, int y)` instead.

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Button;

public class MyButton extends Button {
    public void doSomething(int x, int y) {
        // Check if the point (x, y) is inside the component
        if (inside(x, y)) {
            // Do something
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Button;

public class MyButton extends Button {
    public void doSomething(int x, int y) {
        // Check if the point (x, y) is inside the component
        if (contains(x, y)) {
            // Do something
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace `inside(x, y)` with `contains(x, y)`. This will ensure that your code works with JDK version 1.1 or later.
