Sure! Here's an example refactoring using the deprecated `java.sql.Date.setSeconds(int)` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.sql.Date;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date date = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
        date.setSeconds(30);
        System.out.println(date);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Timestamp timestamp = new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
        timestamp.setSeconds(30);
        System.out.println(new Date(timestamp.getTime()));
    }
}
```

Explanation:

The `java.sql.Date` class is a subclass of `java.util.Date` and represents a SQL `DATE` value, which does not include a time component. The `setSeconds(int)` method sets the seconds component of the date's time value, which is not useful for a `java.sql.Date` object.

To refactor this code, we can replace the `java.sql.Date` object with a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, which represents a SQL `TIMESTAMP` value and includes a time component. We can then set the seconds component of the `Timestamp` object and convert it to a `java.sql.Date` object using the `getTime()` method.

Note that the `java.sql.Timestamp` class also has a deprecated `setSeconds(int)` method, but this method has not been removed yet and can still be used.
