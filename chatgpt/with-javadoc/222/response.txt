Sure, here's an example of refactoring the use of `setLogStream()` to `setLogWriter()`:

Before Refactoring:

```
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
    PrintStream logStream = new PrintStream("log.txt");
    DriverManager.setLogStream(logStream);
  }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException, IOException {
    PrintWriter logWriter = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("log.txt"), true);
    DriverManager.setLogWriter(logWriter);
  }
}
```

In this example, we've replaced the use of `setLogStream()` with `setLogWriter()` and created a new `PrintWriter` object to write the log messages to a file. We also updated the `throws` clause in the `main()` method to include `IOException` because `PrintWriter` may throw an `IOException` if there are any issues writing to the file.

Note that the `PrintWriter` constructor's second parameter, `true`, indicates that we want to flush the output buffer after each log message, which ensures that the messages are written to the file immediately rather than being buffered. This is equivalent to the behavior of `setLogStream()`.
