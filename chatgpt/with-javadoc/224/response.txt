Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `getBigDecimal(int, int)` method to use the suggested replacement method `getBigDecimal(int)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = 123");
BigDecimal price = rs.getBigDecimal(1, 2);
```

After refactoring:

```java
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = 123");
BigDecimal price = rs.getBigDecimal(1);
```

In the refactored code, the deprecated `getBigDecimal(int, int)` method call has been replaced with `getBigDecimal(int)` which is suggested in the deprecation comment. The `int` parameter that specified the scale of the `BigDecimal` is no longer needed because the `getBigDecimal(int)` method returns the entire value of the column as a `BigDecimal`.
