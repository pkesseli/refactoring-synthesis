Sure! Here's an example refactoring that demonstrates how to replace calls to the deprecated `getBigDecimal(String, int)` method with the recommended alternatives:

```java
// Deprecated method call
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT price FROM products");
BigDecimal price = rs.getBigDecimal("price", 2);

// Refactored code using recommended methods
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT price FROM products");
BigDecimal price = rs.getBigDecimal("price");
```

In this example, the deprecated `getBigDecimal(String, int)` method is used to retrieve the value of the "price" column from the ResultSet with a scale of 2. The recommended alternatives are `getBigDecimal(int)` and `getBigDecimal(String)`, which don't take a scale argument and instead return the BigDecimal value as it is stored in the database.

To refactor the code, simply replace the call to `getBigDecimal(String, int)` with a call to either `getBigDecimal(int)` or `getBigDecimal(String)`, depending on whether you prefer to use the column index or column label to identify the column.
