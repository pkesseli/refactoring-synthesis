Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `getUnicodeStream` method in `java.sql.ResultSet`:

```java
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);
while (resultSet.next()) {
    InputStream inputStream = resultSet.getUnicodeStream(1);
    // Do something with the inputStream
}
```

To refactor this code, we can replace the call to `getUnicodeStream` with `getCharacterStream`, as recommended in the deprecation comment:

```java
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);
while (resultSet.next()) {
    Reader reader = resultSet.getCharacterStream(1);
    // Do something with the reader
}
```

This code uses the recommended `getCharacterStream` method instead of the deprecated `getUnicodeStream` method to retrieve the data from the result set. The `Reader` object returned by `getCharacterStream` can be used to read the data as characters, which is the intended usage of the deprecated `getUnicodeStream` method.
