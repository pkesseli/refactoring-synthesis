Sure, I can provide a refactoring example for the deprecated method `java.sql.Time.getDate()`. 

First, let's understand the reason for the deprecation. The `getDate()` method is deprecated because it returns the date portion of the time value as a `java.sql.Date` object, which may cause confusion and errors. It is recommended to use `toLocalTime()` method to get the LocalTime object, and then use `getHour()`, `getMinute()`, and `getSecond()` methods to retrieve the corresponding values. 

So, here is an example of how to refactor the code to use the recommended approach:

Before refactoring:

```java
java.sql.Time time = new java.sql.Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
java.sql.Date date = time.getDate();
```

After refactoring:

```java
java.sql.Time time = new java.sql.Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
LocalTime localTime = time.toLocalTime();
int hour = localTime.getHour();
int minute = localTime.getMinute();
int second = localTime.getSecond();
```

In the refactored code, we first create a `Time` object using the current time in milliseconds. Then, instead of calling the deprecated `getDate()` method, we convert the `Time` object to a `LocalTime` object using the `toLocalTime()` method. Finally, we retrieve the hour, minute, and second values from the `LocalTime` object using the `getHour()`, `getMinute()`, and `getSecond()` methods, respectively.

Note that the refactored code uses the recommended approach and avoids the use of the deprecated method `getDate()`.
