Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `isFocusTraversable()` method to instead use the recommended `isFocusable()` method:

```java
// Before refactoring
Component myComponent = new JButton("Click me!");
if (myComponent.isFocusTraversable()) {
    myComponent.requestFocus();
}

// After refactoring
Component myComponent = new JButton("Click me!");
if (myComponent.isFocusable()) {
    myComponent.requestFocusInWindow();
}
```

In the refactored code, we replace the call to `isFocusTraversable()` with a call to `isFocusable()`. We also replace the call to `requestFocus()` with a call to `requestFocusInWindow()`, which is the recommended way to request focus in Swing components.

Note that `isFocusable()` returns `true` if the component is capable of receiving focus, while `isFocusTraversable()` returns `true` if the component is capable of being traversed by the focus cycle. In most cases, if a component is focusable, it should also be traversable, but this is not always the case (for example, some components may be focusable but not visible in the focus cycle).
