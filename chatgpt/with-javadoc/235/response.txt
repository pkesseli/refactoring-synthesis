Sure, here's an example of refactoring the use of `weakCompareAndSet` method to `weakCompareAndSetPlain` method in a Java program:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean;

public class Example {
  private AtomicBoolean flag = new AtomicBoolean(false);

  public void doSomething() {
    if (flag.weakCompareAndSet(false, true)) {
      // Do something when flag is set to true
    }
  }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean;

public class Example {
  private AtomicBoolean flag = new AtomicBoolean(false);

  public void doSomething() {
    if (flag.weakCompareAndSetPlain(false, true)) {
      // Do something when flag is set to true
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed was to replace the `weakCompareAndSet` method with `weakCompareAndSetPlain` method, as recommended in the Javadoc. This change ensures that the plain memory effects of the method are clear and avoids confusion over volatile memory effects.
