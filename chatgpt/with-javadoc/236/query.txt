The method java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger.weakCompareAndSetâ€‹(int, int) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has plain memory effects but the method
 name implies volatile memory effects (see methods such as
 AtomicInteger.compareAndExchange(int, int) and AtomicInteger.compareAndSet(int, int)).  To avoid
 confusion over plain or volatile memory effects it is recommended that
 the method AtomicInteger.weakCompareAndSetPlain(int, int) be used instead."
Show me a refactoring example.
