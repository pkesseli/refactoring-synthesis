Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `weakCompareAndSet` to use `weakCompareAndSetPlain` instead:

Before:

```java
AtomicIntegerArray array = new AtomicIntegerArray(10);
int index = 5;
int expected = 1;
int update = 2;
array.weakCompareAndSet(index, expected, update);
```

After:

```java
AtomicIntegerArray array = new AtomicIntegerArray(10);
int index = 5;
int expected = 1;
int update = 2;
array.weakCompareAndSetPlain(index, expected, update);
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the `weakCompareAndSet` method call with `weakCompareAndSetPlain`. This ensures that the code will continue to work correctly, while also avoiding confusion over plain or volatile memory effects.
