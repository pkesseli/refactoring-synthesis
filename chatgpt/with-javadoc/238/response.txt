Sure, I can provide you with a refactoring example to update the usage of `AtomicLong.weakCompareAndSet` to `AtomicLong.weakCompareAndSetPlain` method. Here's an example code snippet:

Before Refactoring:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;

public class Counter {
    private final AtomicLong count = new AtomicLong(0);

    public boolean increment(long expectedValue, long newValue) {
        return count.weakCompareAndSet(expectedValue, newValue);
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;

public class Counter {
    private final AtomicLong count = new AtomicLong(0);

    public boolean increment(long expectedValue, long newValue) {
        return count.weakCompareAndSetPlain(expectedValue, newValue);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed in the code is to replace `weakCompareAndSet` with `weakCompareAndSetPlain` method. This way, the code becomes more clear and avoids any confusion regarding memory effects.
