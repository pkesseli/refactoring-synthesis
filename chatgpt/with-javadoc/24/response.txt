Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `java.awt.Component.keyDown(Event, int)` to instead use `processKeyEvent(KeyEvent)`:

Before:

```
public class MyComponent extends java.awt.Canvas {
    public boolean keyDown(Event event, int key) {
        if (key == Event.ENTER) {
            // do something when the Enter key is pressed
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

After:

```
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;

public class MyComponent extends java.awt.Canvas {
    public void processKeyEvent(KeyEvent event) {
        if (event.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_ENTER) {
            // do something when the Enter key is pressed
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, we've replaced the `keyDown` method with `processKeyEvent`. Inside `processKeyEvent`, we can check the key code using `event.getKeyCode()` and handle the key press accordingly. In this example, we're checking for the Enter key press and doing something if it's pressed.
