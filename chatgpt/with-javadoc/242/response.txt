Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses `ThreadPoolExecutor.finalize()` to use a recommended alternative:

Before:
```java
public class MyTaskExecutor {
    private ThreadPoolExecutor executor;

    public MyTaskExecutor() {
        executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(5, 10, 5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1000));
    }

    // Other methods here ...

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        executor.shutdown();
        super.finalize();
    }
}
```

After:
```java
public class MyTaskExecutor {
    private ThreadPoolExecutor executor;

    public MyTaskExecutor() {
        executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(5, 10, 5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1000));
        // Register a hook to shut down the executor when the JVM is shutting down
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(executor::shutdown));
    }

    // Other methods here ...
}
```

In this refactored example, we're replacing the `ThreadPoolExecutor.finalize()` method with a shutdown hook that will be executed when the JVM is shutting down. We're using `Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook()` method to register a hook, which takes a `Thread` object as its argument. We're passing a lambda expression to the `Thread` constructor that calls the `shutdown()` method on the executor.

This ensures that the executor is properly shut down even if the `MyTaskExecutor` object is not garbage collected or if the `finalize()` method is not called. It also avoids using a deprecated method and follows the recommended approach.
