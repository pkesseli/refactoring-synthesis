Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.util.Date.getDate()` method to use the recommended `Calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)` method instead:

```java
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;

public class DateExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date date = new Date();

        // Deprecated method
        int day = date.getDate();
        System.out.println("Day: " + day);

        // Recommended method
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
        calendar.setTime(date);
        int recommendedDay = calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
        System.out.println("Recommended day: " + recommendedDay);
    }

}
```

In this example, we first create a `Date` object using the no-arg constructor, which initializes it with the current date and time. We then call the deprecated `getDate()` method to get the day of the month from the `Date` object.

To refactor this code, we create a `Calendar` object using the `getInstance()` method and set its time to the `Date` object using the `setTime()` method. We then call the recommended `get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)` method to get the day of the month from the `Calendar` object.

This code produces the same output as before, but now uses the recommended method:

```
Day: 5
Recommended day: 5
```
