Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the use of the deprecated `getSeconds()` method in `java.util.Date` to use `Calendar.get(Calendar.SECOND)`:

Before refactoring:
```java
Date now = new Date();
int seconds = now.getSeconds();
```

After refactoring:
```java
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
int seconds = calendar.get(Calendar.SECOND);
```

In the refactored code, we create a `Calendar` object using the `getInstance()` method and then call `get(Calendar.SECOND)` to get the current second. This achieves the same result as calling the deprecated `getSeconds()` method on a `Date` object. 

Note that `Calendar` provides additional methods for getting other fields like minutes, hours, and days, so you can refactor those as well if needed.
