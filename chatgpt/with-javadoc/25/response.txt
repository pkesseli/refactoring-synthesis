Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.keyUp(Event, int)` method to use the recommended `processKeyEvent(KeyEvent)` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Event;

public class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    
    public boolean keyUp(Event evt, int key) {
        // Handle key up event
        return true;
    }
    
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;

public class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    
    @Override
    protected void processKeyEvent(KeyEvent evt) {
        if (evt.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED) {
            // Handle key up event
        }
        super.processKeyEvent(evt);
    }
    
}
```

In the refactored code, we first import the `KeyEvent` class from the `java.awt.event` package, which is where the recommended `processKeyEvent(KeyEvent)` method is defined.

Next, we change the signature of our event handling method to match the recommended method signature. Instead of taking an `Event` object and an integer key code, our new method takes a `KeyEvent` object.

We then override the `processKeyEvent` method, which is called by the AWT event dispatch thread whenever a key event occurs on our component. Inside our implementation of `processKeyEvent`, we check if the key event is a key release event (`KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED`). If it is, we handle the event as we did before in the `keyUp` method.

Finally, we call the `super.processKeyEvent` method to ensure that any other event handling logic defined in our component's superclass is also executed.
