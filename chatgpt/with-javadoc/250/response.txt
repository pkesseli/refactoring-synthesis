Sure, I'd be happy to show you an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `getYear()` method in `java.util.Date`.

Let's say you have the following code that uses the `getYear()` method:

```
import java.util.Date;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date currentDate = new Date();
        int year = currentDate.getYear();
        System.out.println("Current year: " + (year + 1900));
    }
}
```

This code gets the current year using the `getYear()` method, and then adds 1900 to it to get the actual year.

To refactor this code, we need to replace the use of `getYear()` with `Calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 1900`. Here's the refactored code:

```
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
        calendar.setTime(new Date());
        int year = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 1900;
        System.out.println("Current year: " + year);
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we first create a `Calendar` instance and set it to the current date using `calendar.setTime(new Date())`. We then get the year using `calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR)`, and subtract 1900 from it to get the actual year. Finally, we print out the current year using `System.out.println("Current year: " + year)`.

And that's it! This is a simple example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `getYear()` method in `java.util.Date`.
