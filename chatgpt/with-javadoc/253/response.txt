Sure, here is an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.util.Date.setHours(int)` to use `java.util.Calendar.set(int field, int value)` method instead:

```
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;

public class DateRefactorExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Date date = new Date(); // create a new date object

        // Deprecated way to set hours
        date.setHours(10);

        // Refactored way to set hours using Calendar
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
        calendar.setTime(date); // set the calendar's time to the date object
        calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 10); // set the hour of the day to 10

        // Print the date before and after the refactor
        System.out.println("Before refactoring: " + date);
        System.out.println("After refactoring: " + calendar.getTime());
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a new `Date` object and set its hours using the deprecated `setHours(int)` method. We then refactor the code by creating a new `Calendar` object, setting its time to the `Date` object using the `setTime(Date)` method, and setting the hour of the day using the `set(int, int)` method with the `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` constant. Finally, we print the date before and after the refactor to ensure that the refactoring was successful.
