Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.layout()` method:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {

    public void layout() {
        // deprecated method
        super.layout();
        // other layout code
    }

}
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` class extends `Component` and overrides the `layout()` method. The call to `super.layout()` is the deprecated method that we want to replace with `doLayout()`.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {

    public void doLayout() {
        // recommended method
        super.doLayout();
        // other layout code
    }

}
```

In this refactored code, we've simply replaced the call to `super.layout()` with `super.doLayout()`, which is the recommended method according to the Javadoc comment. Note that we're still calling `super.doLayout()` to ensure that the superclass's layout code is executed before our custom layout code.

Keep in mind that this is just a simple example, and the refactoring process may be more complex in a larger codebase. Also, be sure to check the Javadoc for any other deprecated methods that you may be using and replace them accordingly.
