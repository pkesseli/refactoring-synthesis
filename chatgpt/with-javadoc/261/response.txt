Sure, here's an example of how to refactor a call to the deprecated `java.util.logging.Logger.logrb` method to the suggested replacement `Logger.logrb(Level, String, String, ResourceBundle, String, Object...)`.

Let's say you have the following call to the deprecated `Logger.logrb` method:

```java
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("com.example");
logger.logrb(Level.WARNING, null, "myBundle", "MyKey", "Error message");
```

To refactor this call, you can use the suggested replacement `Logger.logrb(Level, String, String, ResourceBundle, String, Object...)`. Here's how you can do it:

```java
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("com.example");
ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("myBundle");
logger.logrb(Level.WARNING, null, bundle, "MyKey", "Error message");
```

In this refactored code, we first obtain a `ResourceBundle` instance for the bundle named "myBundle". Then, we pass this instance to the `Logger.logrb` method instead of the bundle name string. This change conforms to the recommendation in the Javadoc to use the `Logger.logrb` overload that takes a `ResourceBundle` parameter.

Note that in the refactored code, we also pass `null` as the third parameter (the class name string). This is because this parameter is only used to determine the resource bundle name when the bundle name is not explicitly specified. Since we are explicitly specifying the bundle name using a `ResourceBundle` instance, we can pass `null` for this parameter.
