Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `logrb` method to use the recommended `logrb` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyClass {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());
    
    public void myMethod() {
        LOGGER.logrb(Level.INFO, null, "MyClass", "myMethod", "Log message {0}", new Object[]{"param1"});
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;

public class MyClass {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());
    private static final ResourceBundle resourceBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("myResourceBundle");

    public void myMethod() {
        LOGGER.logrb(Level.INFO, null, "MyClass", "myMethod", resourceBundle.getString("logMessage"), "param1");
    }
}
```

In the example above, we've made the following changes:

1. We imported the `java.util.ResourceBundle` class as it's needed to use the `logrb` method with a resource bundle.
2. We created a `ResourceBundle` object named `resourceBundle` that contains the log message as a string.
3. We updated the call to the `logrb` method to use the new method signature, passing the `Level` object, `null` for the resource bundle name, the logger name, the method name, the log message from the `ResourceBundle`, and the parameter value.

Note that the `ResourceBundle` can be created and managed in different ways depending on your needs. In this example, we simply created a new properties file named `myResourceBundle.properties` in the same package as `MyClass` and added the `logMessage` property with the log message as its value.
