Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor a call to the deprecated `Logger.logrb` method using the recommended `Logger.logrb` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("com.example");
logger.logrb(Level.WARNING, null, "myBundle", "logKey", "Unable to connect to database", e);
```

After refactoring:

```java
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("com.example");
ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("myBundle");
logger.logrb(Level.WARNING, null, bundle, "logKey", "Unable to connect to database", e);
```

In the refactored code, we use `ResourceBundle.getBundle` to obtain the ResourceBundle that contains the localized log messages. Then, we pass the ResourceBundle as a parameter to the new `Logger.logrb` method along with the other parameters.

Note that in the refactored code, we pass `null` as the second parameter to the `Logger.logrb` method. This is because the second parameter in the deprecated `Logger.logrb` method was the class name, which is now inferred by the logging system. If you pass a non-null value, it will be ignored.
