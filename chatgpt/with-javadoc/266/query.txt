The method java.util.logging.LogRecord.setMillisâ€‹(long) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "LogRecord maintains timestamps with nanosecond resolution,
             using Instant values. For this reason,
             setInstant()
             should be used in preference to setMillis()."
Show me a refactoring example.
