Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example of refactoring the `finalize()` method using the alternative cleanup mechanism. 

Let's say you have a custom `ImageReader` class that extends the `javax.imageio.ImageReader` class and overrides the `finalize()` method to release resources when the object is garbage collected. Here's an example of how you could refactor this code:

```java
public class MyImageReader extends javax.imageio.ImageReader {

    // ... constructor and other methods ...
    
    // Deprecated finalize() method
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // Release any resources held by this object
            releaseResources();
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
    
    // Alternative cleanup mechanism
    public void close() {
        // Release any resources held by this object
        releaseResources();
    }
    
    private void releaseResources() {
        // Implementation details for releasing resources go here
        // For example:
        //   - Closing any open files or network connections
        //   - Releasing any memory allocated by this object
        //   - Nulling out any fields that reference other objects
    }
}
```

In the refactored code above, we've added a new `close()` method that performs the same cleanup logic as the `finalize()` method. Instead of relying on the `finalize()` method to release resources, we can now call the `close()` method explicitly to ensure that resources are released in a timely and predictable manner.

Here's an example of how we could use the `MyImageReader` class with the new `close()` method:

```java
try (MyImageReader reader = new MyImageReader()) {
    // Use the reader object to read images
    // ...
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle any exceptions that occur while reading images
} finally {
    // No need to call finalize() explicitly
}
```

In the example above, we've used a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the `close()` method is called automatically when the `reader` object goes out of scope. This is a convenient way to ensure that resources are released even if an exception is thrown while reading images.
