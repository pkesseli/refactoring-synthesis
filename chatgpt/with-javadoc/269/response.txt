Sure, here's an example refactoring that removes the usage of the `finalize()` method in `javax.imageio.stream.FileCacheImageInputStream`:

Before:

```java
public class FileCacheImageInputStream extends ImageInputStreamImpl {
    // Other class members here...
    
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            close();
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

After:

```java
public class FileCacheImageInputStream extends ImageInputStreamImpl {
    // Other class members here...

    public void close() throws IOException {
        super.close();
        // Other cleanup code here...
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've removed the `finalize()` method and replaced it with a `close()` method that performs the necessary cleanup. The `close()` method is called explicitly by the user of the `FileCacheImageInputStream` instance, instead of relying on the garbage collector to call `finalize()`. This makes the cleanup more predictable and reliable.

Note that the specific cleanup code in the `close()` method will depend on the needs of your application and the behavior of the `FileCacheImageInputStream` class. The key point is to move the cleanup logic out of the `finalize()` method and into a method that is called explicitly.
