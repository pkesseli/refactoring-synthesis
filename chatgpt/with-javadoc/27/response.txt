Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor your code to replace the deprecated `locate(int, int)` method with `getComponentAt(int, int)`:

Before refactoring:

```
Component component = someContainer.locate(x, y);
```

After refactoring:

```
Component component = someContainer.getComponentAt(x, y);
```

In this example, we simply replaced the `locate` method call with the suggested replacement method `getComponentAt`. This should have the same behavior as the original code but without using a deprecated method.

It's important to note that if you're using a version of Java that's older than JDK 1.1, you may not be able to use `getComponentAt` and will need to continue using `locate` or find an alternative method that works for your situation.
