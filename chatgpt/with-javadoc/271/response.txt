Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to avoid using the `finalize()` method and use alternative cleanup mechanisms:

Original code with deprecated `finalize()` method:

```java
import javax.imageio.stream.FileImageOutputStream;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ImageWriter {
    private FileImageOutputStream outputStream;
    
    public ImageWriter(File file) throws IOException {
        outputStream = new FileImageOutputStream(file);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws IOException {
        outputStream.close();
    }
    
    // other methods to write images...
}
```

Refactored code without `finalize()` method:

```java
import javax.imageio.stream.FileImageOutputStream;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ImageWriter {
    private FileImageOutputStream outputStream;
    private File outputFile;
    
    public ImageWriter(File file) throws IOException {
        outputFile = file;
        outputStream = new FileImageOutputStream(outputFile);
    }
    
    public void close() throws IOException {
        outputStream.close();
    }
    
    // other methods to write images...
}
```

In the refactored code, we've introduced a `close()` method to explicitly close the `FileImageOutputStream`. This method can be called by the user of the class when they're done writing images to the output file. 

It's important to note that if the `ImageWriter` class is used in a try-with-resources block, then the `close()` method will be called automatically when the block is exited. 

Here's an example of how the refactored code can be used:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File outputFile = new File("output.png");
            
            // Using try-with-resources to automatically close the ImageWriter
            try (ImageWriter writer = new ImageWriter(outputFile)) {
                // Write images using writer methods...
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ImageWriter` instance is created inside a try-with-resources block, which automatically calls the `close()` method when the block is exited, ensuring that the `FileImageOutputStream` is properly closed.
