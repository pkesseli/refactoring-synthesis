Sure, here is an example of how to refactor a class that overrides the `finalize()` method of `ImageInputStreamImpl` to use alternative cleanup mechanisms and remove the overriding `finalize()` method:

Before refactoring:

```
public class MyImageInputStreamImpl extends ImageInputStreamImpl {

    // constructor, fields, and methods omitted for brevity

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // cleanup code here
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
public class MyImageInputStreamImpl extends ImageInputStreamImpl {

    // constructor, fields, and methods omitted for brevity

    public void close() throws IOException {
        // cleanup code here
        super.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have removed the `finalize()` method and added a `close()` method that performs the necessary cleanup. We also call `super.close()` to ensure that the parent class's cleanup code is executed as well.

By using the `close()` method instead of `finalize()`, we are following the recommended alternative cleanup mechanism and avoiding potential issues with the `finalize()` method, such as not being guaranteed to run at all or running too late.
