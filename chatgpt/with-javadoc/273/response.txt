Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the `finalize()` method in a class that extends `MemoryCacheImageInputStream`:

Before:

```java
public class MyImageInputStream extends MemoryCacheImageInputStream {

    // constructor and other methods omitted for brevity

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // perform cleanup
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

After:

```java
public class MyImageInputStream extends MemoryCacheImageInputStream {

    // constructor and other methods omitted for brevity

    public void close() throws IOException {
        // perform cleanup
        super.close();
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the `finalize()` method has been replaced with a `close()` method. This is a common pattern in Java classes that manage system resources such as input and output streams.

The `close()` method performs the necessary cleanup, and also calls the `close()` method of the superclass (`MemoryCacheImageInputStream`). The `try-finally` block in the original `finalize()` method is no longer needed, since the `close()` method will be called automatically when the object is no longer needed.

It's worth noting that the `close()` method is not a direct replacement for `finalize()`. In particular, `close()` should be called explicitly by the client code (usually in a `finally` block), whereas `finalize()` is called automatically by the garbage collector. However, in most cases using a `close()` method is a safer and more predictable way to manage resources in Java.
