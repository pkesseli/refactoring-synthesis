Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor your code to use the recommended replacement method, `CounterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor(mBeanServer, counterName, threshold);
long timeStamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
```

After refactoring:

```java
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("Your MBean's ObjectName");
CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
counterMonitor.addObservedObject(objectName);
counterMonitor.setCounter(counterName);
counterMonitor.setThreshold(threshold);
long timeStamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
```

In the refactored code, we first create an `ObjectName` instance representing our MBean's `ObjectName`. Then, we create an instance of `CounterMonitor` and add the MBean's `ObjectName` to the list of observed objects. We then set the counter name and threshold as before, and finally, we call the replacement method `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` with our MBean's `ObjectName` as the argument. This will return the same value that we would have gotten before using the now-deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method.
