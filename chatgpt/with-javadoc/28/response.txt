Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor your code to use the non-deprecated method `getLocation()` instead of the deprecated `location()` method:

Before Refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void printLocation() {
        System.out.println(location()); // using deprecated location() method
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Point;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void printLocation() {
        Point location = getLocation(); // using getLocation() method
        System.out.println(location);
    }
}
```

As you can see, we replaced the usage of `location()` method with `getLocation()` method, which returns a `Point` object containing the x and y coordinates of the component's top-left corner. This way, we avoid using the deprecated method and make our code more maintainable and up-to-date with the latest Java API.
