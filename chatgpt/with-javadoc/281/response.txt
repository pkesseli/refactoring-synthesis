Sure, here's an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated `setThreshold` method to use the replacement `setInitThreshold` method:

Before refactoring:

```
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;

public class CounterMonitorExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CounterMonitor monitor = new CounterMonitor();
        monitor.setThreshold(1000L);
        // Other code here...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;

public class CounterMonitorExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CounterMonitor monitor = new CounterMonitor();
        monitor.setInitThreshold(1000L);
        // Other code here...
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the `setThreshold` method has been replaced with the `setInitThreshold` method, which is the recommended replacement as stated in the Javadoc comment. The method call now uses a `Long` object instead of a `Number` object, but this should not affect the functionality of the code in this case.
