Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method to use the recommended `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class MyCounterMonitor {

  private CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor;

  public MyCounterMonitor() {
    // initialize the counter monitor
    CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
    // set up the counter monitor
    counterMonitor.setObservedObject(new ObjectName("myCounter:type=Counter"));
    counterMonitor.setThresholds(new Integer(10), new Integer(20));
    counterMonitor.setNotify(true);
    counterMonitor.setDifferenceMode(true);
    this.counterMonitor = counterMonitor;
  }

  public Number getDerivedGauge() {
    // return the derived gauge of the counter monitor
    return counterMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
  }

}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.ObjectName;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class MyCounterMonitor {

  private CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor;

  public MyCounterMonitor() {
    // initialize the counter monitor
    CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
    // set up the counter monitor
    counterMonitor.setObservedObject(new ObjectName("myCounter:type=Counter"));
    counterMonitor.setThresholds(new Integer(10), new Integer(20));
    counterMonitor.setNotify(true);
    counterMonitor.setDifferenceMode(true);
    this.counterMonitor = counterMonitor;
  }

  public Number getDerivedGauge() {
    // return the derived gauge of the counter monitor
    return counterMonitor.getDerivedGauge(counterMonitor.getObservedObject());
  }

}
```

As you can see, the only change made was to replace the call to `getDerivedGauge()` with a call to `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)`, passing in the object name returned by `getObservedObject()`. This ensures that the code now uses the recommended method instead of the deprecated one.
