Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the new method `CounterMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` instead of the deprecated `CounterMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method:

```java
// deprecated method
// long timeStamp = counterMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();

// new method
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=CounterMonitor");
long timeStamp = counterMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
```

In the example above, we first create an `ObjectName` instance with the name of the `CounterMonitor` MBean that we want to get the derived gauge timestamp from. Then, we call the new `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method on the `CounterMonitorMBean` instance, passing in the `ObjectName` instance as a parameter. The method will then return the derived gauge timestamp as a `long` value.

Note that you'll need to import the `javax.management.ObjectName` class if you haven't done so already. Also, make sure that you replace all instances of the deprecated method with the new method in your code.
