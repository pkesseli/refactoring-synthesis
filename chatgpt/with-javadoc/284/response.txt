Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor your code to use the replacement method, `CounterMonitorMBean.getThreshold(ObjectName)` instead of the deprecated method, `CounterMonitorMBean.getThreshold()`:

```java
// Before refactoring:
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = // initialize counter monitor
Number threshold = counterMonitor.getThreshold(); // deprecated method

// After refactoring:
CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = // initialize counter monitor
ObjectName objectName = // initialize object name for the MBean
Number threshold = counterMonitor.getThreshold(objectName); // replacement method
```

As you can see, the main change here is that we're now passing an `ObjectName` parameter to the `getThreshold()` method instead of calling it without any parameters. This should give you the same functionality as before, but without using the deprecated method.
