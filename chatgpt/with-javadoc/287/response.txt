Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to replace the deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method with `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitor;
import javax.management.ObjectName;

public class MyMonitor {

    private GaugeMonitor gaugeMonitor;

    public long getLastDerivedGaugeTimeStamp() {
        return gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitor;
import javax.management.ObjectName;

public class MyMonitor {

    private GaugeMonitor gaugeMonitor;

    public long getLastDerivedGaugeTimeStamp() {
        ObjectName objectName = gaugeMonitor.getObservedObject();
        return gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we first obtain the `ObjectName` of the observed MBean using the `getObservedObject()` method of `GaugeMonitor`. We then pass this `ObjectName` to the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method to obtain the derived gauge time stamp.

Note that the `getObservedObject()` method itself is not deprecated, so we can continue to use it to obtain the `ObjectName` of the observed MBean.
