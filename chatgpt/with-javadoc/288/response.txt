Sure, here is an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated method `javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitorMBean.getDerivedGauge()` to use the replacement method `GaugeMonitorMBean.getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` instead:

```java
// Before refactoring:
GaugeMonitorMBean gaugeMonitor = ...;
Number derivedGauge = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGauge();

// After refactoring:
GaugeMonitorMBean gaugeMonitor = ...;
ObjectName objectName = ...; // replace with appropriate object name
Number derivedGauge = gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGauge(objectName);
```

In this example, we have replaced the call to the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method with a call to the replacement method `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)`. We have also added a new `ObjectName` parameter to the method call to specify the object name for which we want to retrieve the derived gauge value.

Note that in this example, we have assumed that you already know the appropriate `ObjectName` to use. If you need help determining the appropriate object name, you may need to consult the JMX documentation or seek assistance from someone familiar with the system you are working with.
