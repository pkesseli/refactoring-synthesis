Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method to use the suggested replacement, `GaugeMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitorMBean;

public class ExampleMonitor {
    private GaugeMonitorMBean monitor;

    public long getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp() {
        return monitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.ObjectName;
import javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitorMBean;

public class ExampleMonitor {
    private GaugeMonitorMBean monitor;

    public long getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName objectName) {
        return monitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
    }
}
```

As you can see, we've updated the `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method to take an additional argument, an `ObjectName` parameter, which is required by the new method signature. We can then pass the appropriate `ObjectName` to the method when we call it, as follows:

```java
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=ExampleMonitor");
long timeStamp = exampleMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
``` 

This should produce the same result as calling the deprecated method, but with the added benefit of using the recommended replacement.
