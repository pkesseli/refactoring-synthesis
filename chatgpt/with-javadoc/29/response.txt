Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the recommended method `processFocusEvent(FocusEvent)` instead of the deprecated method `lostFocus(Event, Object)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    
    public void lostFocus(Event evt, Object obj) {
        // do something when the component loses focus
    }
    
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    
    protected void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent evt) {
        if (evt.getID() == FocusEvent.FOCUS_LOST) {
            // do something when the component loses focus
        }
        super.processFocusEvent(evt);
    }
    
}
```

As you can see, we have removed the deprecated method `lostFocus(Event, Object)` and replaced it with the recommended method `processFocusEvent(FocusEvent)`. In the new implementation, we check if the event ID is `FOCUS_LOST` and perform the required action. We then call the superclass implementation of `processFocusEvent()` to ensure that any other focus event processing is also handled correctly.
