Sure! Here is an example of how you can refactor your code to replace the deprecated `Monitor.getObservedObject()` method with the recommended `Monitor.getObservedObjects()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
// create a monitor object
Monitor myMonitor = new Monitor();

// set the observed object for the monitor
Object observedObject = someObject;
myMonitor.setObservedObject(observedObject);

// get the observed object from the monitor
Object myObservedObject = myMonitor.getObservedObject();
```

After refactoring:

```java
// create a monitor object
Monitor myMonitor = new Monitor();

// set the observed objects for the monitor
Object[] observedObjects = { someObject };
myMonitor.setObservedObjects(observedObjects);

// get the observed objects from the monitor
Object[] myObservedObjects = myMonitor.getObservedObjects();

// get the first observed object from the array (same as the original observed object)
Object myObservedObject = myObservedObjects[0];
```

As you can see, the main difference is that instead of setting and getting a single observed object, we are now using an array of observed objects. In this case, since we only have one observed object, we create an array with a single element. To get the original observed object, we simply retrieve the first element of the array.
