Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated method `javax.management.monitor.StringMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` to use the new method `StringMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` instead:

Before refactoring:

```
import javax.management.monitor.StringMonitorMBean;

public class Example {
    private StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor;

    public long getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp() {
        return stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import javax.management.ObjectName;
import javax.management.monitor.StringMonitorMBean;

public class Example {
    private StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor;

    public long getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp() {
        ObjectName objectName = stringMonitor.getObservedObject();
        return stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(objectName);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the refactored code first gets the `ObjectName` of the observed MBean using the `StringMonitorMBean.getObservedObject()` method, and then passes it to the `StringMonitorMBean.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp(ObjectName)` method to get the derived gauge timestamp. This allows you to replace the use of the deprecated method while still achieving the same functionality.
