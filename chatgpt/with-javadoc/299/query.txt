The method javax.management.ValueExp.setMBeanServerâ€‹(MBeanServer) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is not needed because a
 ValueExp can access the MBean server in which it
 is being evaluated by using QueryEval.getMBeanServer()."
Show me a refactoring example.
