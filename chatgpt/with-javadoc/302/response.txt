Sure, here's an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `setUnicodeStream` method with the suggested `getCharacterStream` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
try {
    BaseRowSet rowSet = new CachedRowSetImpl();
    InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream("hello world".getBytes());
    rowSet.setUnicodeStream(1, inputStream, 11);
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
try {
    BaseRowSet rowSet = new CachedRowSetImpl();
    Reader reader = new StringReader("hello world");
    rowSet.setCharacterStream(1, reader, 11);
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the refactored code, we create a `StringReader` object from the string we want to set as a character stream, and pass it as the second argument to `setCharacterStream` method. We also replace the deprecated method `setUnicodeStream` with `setCharacterStream` method, which is suggested in the Javadoc comment. 

Note that the `setCharacterStream` method takes a `Reader` object instead of an `InputStream` object. This is because `setCharacterStream` is intended to work with character data, whereas `setUnicodeStream` was intended to work with binary Unicode data.
