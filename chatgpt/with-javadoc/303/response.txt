Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses `getLabel()` to use `getText()` instead:

Before refactoring:
```
JButton button = new JButton("Click me");
String label = button.getLabel();
System.out.println("Button label: " + label);
```

After refactoring:
```
JButton button = new JButton("Click me");
String text = button.getText();
System.out.println("Button text: " + text);
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated method `getLabel()` with the recommended method `getText()` to retrieve the text content of the button. We also updated the variable name to reflect the change in functionality.
