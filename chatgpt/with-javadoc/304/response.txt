Sure! Here's an example of refactoring the use of `setLabel` to `setText`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.swing.*;

public class MyButton extends JButton {
    
    public MyButton() {
        setLabel("Click me");
    }
    
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.swing.*;

public class MyButton extends JButton {
    
    public MyButton() {
        setText("Click me");
    }
    
}
```

In this example, we simply replaced the use of `setLabel` with `setText` to update the button's text. This ensures that the code will continue to work correctly as `setLabel` is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of Java.
