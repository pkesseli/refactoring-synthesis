Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `javax.swing.FocusManager.isFocusManagerEnabled()` to use `KeyboardFocusManager.getDefaultFocusTraversalPolicy()` instead.

Let's say we have a class called `MyComponent` that extends `JComponent` and we want to check whether the focus manager is enabled or not. Here's what the code might look like using the deprecated method:

```
public class MyComponent extends JComponent {
    public void someMethod() {
        if (FocusManager.isFocusManagerEnabled()) {
            // do something if focus manager is enabled
        } else {
            // do something else if focus manager is disabled
        }
    }
}
```

To refactor this code to use `KeyboardFocusManager.getDefaultFocusTraversalPolicy()`, we can modify `someMethod()` as follows:

```
public class MyComponent extends JComponent {
    public void someMethod() {
        KeyboardFocusManager focusManager = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager();
        if (focusManager.getDefaultFocusTraversalPolicy() != null) {
            // do something if focus manager is enabled
        } else {
            // do something else if focus manager is disabled
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we're using `KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager()` to get an instance of the current focus manager, and then calling `getDefaultFocusTraversalPolicy()` on that instance to check whether the focus manager is enabled or not.

Note that `getDefaultFocusTraversalPolicy()` returns `null` if the focus manager is disabled, so we're checking for `null` to determine whether the focus manager is enabled or not.

By making this simple change to our code, we've updated it to use the recommended method and removed the use of the deprecated method.
