Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `disable()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.disable(); // deprecated method
```

After refactoring:

```java
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.setEnabled(false);
```

In the refactored code, we replace the `disable()` method with the `setEnabled(false)` method, which is the recommended replacement method as mentioned in the deprecation comment. This will have the same effect as disabling the component.
