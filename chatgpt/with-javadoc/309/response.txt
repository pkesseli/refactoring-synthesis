Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `enable()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.enable(false);
```

After refactoring:

```java
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.setEnabled(false);
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `enable()` method with the suggested `setEnabled()` method, which has the same functionality but is not deprecated. This will ensure that our code works correctly and is also more maintainable in the future.
