Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `getNextFocusableComponent()` to use `FocusTraversalPolicy` instead:

Before refactoring:

```
JButton button1 = new JButton("Button 1");
JButton button2 = new JButton("Button 2");
button1.setNextFocusableComponent(button2);
```

After refactoring:

```
JButton button1 = new JButton("Button 1");
JButton button2 = new JButton("Button 2");
FocusTraversalPolicy policy = new LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy() {
    public Component getDefaultComponent(Container cont) {
        return button1;
    }
};
button1.setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider(true);
button1.setFocusTraversalPolicy(policy);
```

In the refactored code, we create a new `LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy` and override its `getDefaultComponent()` method to return the component we want to be focused first (in this case, `button1`). Then we set this policy on `button1` using `setFocusTraversalPolicy()`, and also set `setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider(true)` so that this component provides its own focus traversal policy. 

Note that this is just a simple example and your specific use case may require more customization of the `FocusTraversalPolicy`.
