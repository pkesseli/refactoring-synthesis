Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.JComponent.isManagingFocus()` method to use the recommended alternatives `Component.setFocusTraversalKeys(int, Set)` and `Container.setFocusCycleRoot(boolean)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
JButton button = new JButton("Click me!");
if (button.isManagingFocus()) {
   // do something
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
JButton button = new JButton("Click me!");
Container container = button.getFocusCycleRootAncestor();
if (container != null) {
   container.setFocusCycleRoot(true);
   button.setFocusTraversalKeys(KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS, null);
   button.setFocusTraversalKeys(KeyboardFocusManager.BACKWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS, null);
}
```

In the refactored code, we first get the focus cycle root ancestor of the button using the `getFocusCycleRootAncestor()` method. If the ancestor is not null, we set it as the focus cycle root using the `setFocusCycleRoot(true)` method. We then clear the forward and backward traversal keys for the button using the `setFocusTraversalKeys(int, Set)` method, passing in `null` as the `Set` parameter to clear the keys.

Note that the refactored code assumes that the button is a part of a focus traversal cycle. If it is not, you may need to add it to a focus traversal policy using the `setFocusTraversalPolicy(FocusTraversalPolicy)` method.
