Sure! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses `JComponent.reshape()` to use `Component.setBounds()` instead:

Before:

```java
JButton button = new JButton("Click me!");
button.reshape(50, 50, 100, 30);
```

After:

```java
JButton button = new JButton("Click me!");
button.setBounds(50, 50, 100, 30);
```

In the refactored code, we simply replace the call to `reshape()` with a call to `setBounds()`. The parameters for both methods are the same, so we can just copy them over directly.

Note that while `JComponent.reshape()` is deprecated, it will still work for the time being. However, it's always a good idea to keep your code up-to-date and use non-deprecated methods whenever possible.
