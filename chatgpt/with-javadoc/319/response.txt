Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to replace the deprecated method `getComponentAtIndex(int)` with the new method `getComponent(int i)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
JMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();
// ...
Component component = menuBar.getComponentAtIndex(0);
```

After refactoring:

```java
JMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();
// ...
Component component = menuBar.getComponent(0);
```

As you can see, the only change required is to replace the method name `getComponentAtIndex(int)` with `getComponent(int i)`. This change will ensure that your code works correctly and avoids using deprecated APIs.
