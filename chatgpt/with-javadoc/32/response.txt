Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.mouseDrag(Event, int, int)` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    // ...
    
    @Override
    public void mouseDrag(Event e, int x, int y) {
        // Do something when the mouse is dragged
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    // ...
    
    @Override
    public void processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent e) {
        if (e.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_DRAGGED) {
            int x = e.getX();
            int y = e.getY();
            
            // Do something when the mouse is dragged
        }
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `mouseDrag` method with the recommended `processMouseMotionEvent` method. We've also updated the method signature to take a `MouseEvent` instead of an `Event` and to remove the `x` and `y` parameters. Finally, we've added an `if` statement to check if the event ID is `MouseEvent.MOUSE_DRAGGED`, which is equivalent to the old `mouseDrag` method. Inside the `if` statement, we get the `x` and `y` coordinates from the `MouseEvent` object and do whatever processing we need to do.
