Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `getText()` method of `JPasswordField`:

```java
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
String password = passwordField.getText(); // Deprecated method
```

To refactor this code, we can replace the `getText()` method with the recommended `getPassword()` method:

```java
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
char[] passwordChars = passwordField.getPassword(); // Recommended method
String password = new String(passwordChars);
```

The `getPassword()` method returns a `char` array, so we convert it to a `String` using the `String` constructor that takes a `char` array as an argument. This way, we can still work with the password as a `String`.

Note that using a `String` to store passwords is generally discouraged, as `String` objects are immutable and therefore cannot be cleared from memory. Instead, it's recommended to work with `char` arrays and clear them from memory when they're no longer needed.
