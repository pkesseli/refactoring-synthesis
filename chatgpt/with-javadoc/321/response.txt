Sure! Here's an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated `getText(int, int)` method of `JPasswordField` to use the recommended `getPassword()` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
// ...
String password = new String(passwordField.getText(0, passwordField.getPassword().length));
```

After refactoring:

```java
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
// ...
char[] passwordChars = passwordField.getPassword();
String password = new String(passwordChars);
```

In the refactored code, we're using the `getPassword()` method to retrieve the password as a `char` array, and then creating a `String` from that array. This is safer than using the `getText(int, int)` method, which returns a `String` that can be accessed and manipulated like any other `String`, potentially exposing the password in memory. 

Note that in general, it's a good idea to avoid creating `String` objects from passwords altogether, since `String`s are immutable and can't be cleared from memory after they're no longer needed. Instead, you should use `char` arrays to store passwords, and clear them from memory as soon as possible.
