Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses `getComponentAtIndex(int)` to use `getComponent(int)` instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
JPopupMenu popupMenu = new JPopupMenu();
Component component = popupMenu.getComponentAtIndex(0);
```

After refactoring:

```java
JPopupMenu popupMenu = new JPopupMenu();
Component component = popupMenu.getComponent(0);
```

As you can see, the only change is to replace the deprecated `getComponentAtIndex(int)` method with the non-deprecated `getComponent(int)` method. This will achieve the same result without using deprecated methods.
