Sure, here's an example of how to refactor your code to use `getJMenuBar()` instead of `getMenuBar()`:

Before:

```java
JFrame frame = new JFrame("My Application");
JMenuBar menuBar = frame.getRootPane().getMenuBar();
```

After:

```java
JFrame frame = new JFrame("My Application");
JMenuBar menuBar = frame.getJMenuBar();
```

As you can see, the only change required is to replace the call to `getRootPane().getMenuBar()` with a call to `getJMenuBar()`. This should resolve the deprecation warning and ensure your code remains compatible with newer versions of Swing.
