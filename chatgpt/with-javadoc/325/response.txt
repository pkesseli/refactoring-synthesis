Sure, here is an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `createScrollPaneForTable` method:

Before refactoring:

```
JTable myTable = new JTable();
JScrollPane scrollPane = JTable.createScrollPaneForTable(myTable);
```

After refactoring:

```
JTable myTable = new JTable();
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(myTable);
```

In the refactored code, we create a new `JScrollPane` instance and pass the `myTable` instance to it as a parameter. This achieves the same result as the deprecated `createScrollPaneForTable` method, but without using a deprecated method.
