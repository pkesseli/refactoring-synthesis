Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `sizeColumnsToFit(boolean)` method of `JTable` to use the recommended `doLayout()` method instead.

Before refactoring:

```java
JTable table = new JTable(data, headers);
table.sizeColumnsToFit(true);
```

After refactoring:

```java
JTable table = new JTable(data, headers);
table.doLayout();
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the deprecated `sizeColumnsToFit(boolean)` method with the recommended `doLayout()` method. This should produce the same result as before, while also ensuring that your code stays up-to-date with the latest best practices in Swing programming.
