Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the `setScrollMode` method instead of `setBackingStoreEnabled`.

Before:

```java
JViewport viewport = new JViewport();
viewport.setBackingStoreEnabled(true);
```

After:

```java
JViewport viewport = new JViewport();
viewport.setScrollMode(JViewport.BACKINGSTORE_SCROLL_MODE);
```

In the new code, we use the `setScrollMode` method with the `BACKINGSTORE_SCROLL_MODE` constant as its argument to achieve the same result as the old code with `setBackingStoreEnabled`. This way, we avoid using a deprecated method and ensure compatibility with newer versions of Java.
