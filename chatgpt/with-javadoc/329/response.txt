Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.KeyStroke.getKeyStrokeâ€‹(char, boolean)` method to use the recommended `getKeyStroke(char)` method instead.

Suppose you have the following code that uses the deprecated `getKeyStroke(char, boolean)` method:

```java
import javax.swing.KeyStroke;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KeyStroke keyStroke = KeyStroke.getKeyStroke('a', true);
        System.out.println(keyStroke);
    }
}
```

To refactor this code to use the recommended `getKeyStroke(char)` method, you can simply replace the deprecated method call with the new method call like this:

```java
import javax.swing.KeyStroke;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KeyStroke keyStroke = KeyStroke.getKeyStroke('a');
        System.out.println(keyStroke);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change we made was to remove the second argument (`true`) from the `getKeyStroke()` method call. This is because the `getKeyStroke(char)` method now includes the `true` argument by default, so it's no longer necessary to specify it explicitly.

By making this change, we have updated our code to use the recommended method and eliminated the use of the deprecated method.
