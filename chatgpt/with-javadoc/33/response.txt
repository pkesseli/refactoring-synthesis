Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `mouseEnter` method in Java to use the recommended `processMouseEvent` method instead.

Deprecated Code:
```java
public void mouseEnter(Event evt, int x, int y) {
    // do something
}
```

Refactored Code:
```java
public void processMouseEvent(MouseEvent evt) {
    if (evt.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_ENTERED) {
        int x = evt.getX();
        int y = evt.getY();
        // do something
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we're using the `processMouseEvent` method as recommended. We're checking the ID of the event to see if it's a `MOUSE_ENTERED` event, which is equivalent to the old `mouseEnter` method. Then, we're extracting the x and y coordinates from the event and performing whatever actions we need to. This way, we're updating our code to use the new method while still preserving the same functionality.
