Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the new method `TextUI.viewToModel2D` instead of the deprecated `BasicTextUI.viewToModel`.

Before refactoring:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point point = new Point(50, 100);
int caretPosition = ((BasicTextUI)textComponent.getUI()).viewToModel(textComponent, point);
```

After refactoring:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point2D point2D = new Point2D.Float(50, 100);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int caretPosition = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel2D(textComponent, point2D, bias);
```

As you can see, we've replaced the `Point` object with a `Point2D` object, and we've added an array of `Position.Bias` objects to the method call. The `Position.Bias` array is used to return information about the location of the mouse click in relation to the text component.

Note that we're also using the `getUI()` method on the `textComponent` object to get the `TextUI` object, instead of casting it to `BasicTextUI`. This is because the `getUI()` method returns the correct type of `TextUI` object for the current look and feel, whereas casting it to `BasicTextUI` would only work with the default look and feel.
