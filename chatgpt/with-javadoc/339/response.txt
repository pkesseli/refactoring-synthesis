Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI.viewToModel` method to use the replacement `TextUI.viewToModel2D` method instead.

Let's say you have a `JTextComponent` object named `myTextComponent` and you want to get the model offset of a point in the component. Here's an example of how you might have done this using the deprecated `viewToModel` method:

```
Point point = new Point(100, 50);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int offset = ((BasicTextUI) myTextComponent.getUI()).viewToModel(myTextComponent, point, bias);
```

To refactor this code to use the replacement `viewToModel2D` method, you would need to make a few changes. First, you'll need to change the type of the `point` variable from `Point` to `Point2D`. Then, you'll need to update the method call to use `TextUI.viewToModel2D` instead of `BasicTextUI.viewToModel`. Here's what the refactored code would look like:

```
Point2D point = new Point2D.Double(100, 50);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int offset = myTextComponent.getUI().viewToModel2D(myTextComponent, point, bias);
```

Note that in the refactored code, we're calling the `viewToModel2D` method on the `TextUI` object returned by `myTextComponent.getUI()`. We're also using a `Point2D` object instead of a `Point` object for the `point` variable.

I hope this example helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
