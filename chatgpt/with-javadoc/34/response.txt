Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `mouseExit` method to use the recommended `processMouseEvent` method instead:

Before:

```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
  
  public void mouseExit(Event e, int x, int y) {
    // do something when the mouse exits the component
  }
  
}
```

After:

```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
  
  public void processMouseEvent(MouseEvent e) {
    if (e.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_EXITED) {
      // do something when the mouse exits the component
    }
    super.processMouseEvent(e);
  }
  
}
```

In this example, we've replaced the `mouseExit` method with an implementation of `processMouseEvent` that checks if the event ID is `MouseEvent.MOUSE_EXITED` and performs the same action as before. We then call `super.processMouseEvent(e)` to ensure that any other necessary processing is still performed.
