Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `modelToView` method to use the replacement `modelToView2D` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
MultiTextUI multiTextUI = new MultiTextUI();
int offset = 10;
Rectangle rect = multiTextUI.modelToView(textComponent, offset);
```

After refactoring:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
int offset = 10;
Rectangle2D rect2D = textUI.modelToView2D(textComponent, offset, Position.Bias.Forward);
Rectangle rect = rect2D.getBounds();
```

In the refactored code, we first obtain the `TextUI` instance for the `JTextComponent`, which can be done using the `getUI()` method. Then we call the `modelToView2D` method on the `TextUI` instance, passing in the text component, the offset, and the bias (which is required by the replacement method). 

Note that the `modelToView2D` method returns a `Rectangle2D` object instead of a `Rectangle` object. To convert this to a `Rectangle` object, we can call the `getBounds` method on the `Rectangle2D` object.
