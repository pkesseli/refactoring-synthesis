Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses `java.awt.Component.mouseMove(Event, int, int)` to use the recommended replacement, `processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public boolean mouseMove(Event evt, int x, int y) {
        // handle mouse move event
        // ...
        return true;
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent evt) {
        super.processMouseMotionEvent(evt);
        // handle mouse move event
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the `mouseMove(Event, int, int)` method with `processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent)`. We've also added a call to `super.processMouseMotionEvent(evt)` to ensure that the component's superclass handles the event as well.

Note that `processMouseMotionEvent(MouseEvent)` is not a new method - it has been part of the `java.awt.Component` class since JDK version 1.1, and is now the recommended way to handle mouse motion events in Java.
