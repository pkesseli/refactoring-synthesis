Sure! Here is an example of how you can refactor your code to use the `TextUI.viewToModel2D()` method instead of the deprecated `TextUI.viewToModel()` method.

Before refactoring:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point point = new Point(10, 20);
int offset = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel(textComponent, point);
```

After refactoring:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point2D point2D = new Point2D.Double(10, 20);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int offset = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel2D(textComponent, point2D, bias);
```

As you can see, we replaced the `Point` object with a `Point2D` object, and added a `Position.Bias[]` parameter to the `viewToModel2D()` method call. The `Position.Bias[]` parameter is used to return the bias of the position that was returned by the method. In this example, we just pass in an array with a single element, but if you were calling this method multiple times, you could reuse the same array to reduce object creation.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
