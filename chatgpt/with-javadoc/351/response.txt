Sure, I'd be happy to provide you with a refactoring example. Here is an example of how you can update your code to use the new `viewToModel2D` method instead of the deprecated `viewToModel` method:

Before refactoring:
```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point point = new Point(10, 10);
Position.Bias[] bias = {Position.Bias.Forward};
int modelIndex = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel(textComponent, point, bias);
```

After refactoring:
```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point2D point = new Point2D.Double(10, 10);
Position.Bias[] bias = {Position.Bias.Forward};
int modelIndex = textComponent.getUI().viewToModel2D(textComponent, point, bias);
```

As you can see, the main difference is that the `Point` argument has been replaced with a `Point2D` argument. In the refactored code, we create a new `Point2D` object using the `Double` constructor and pass it to the `viewToModel2D` method instead of the `Point` object.
