Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `javax.swing.RepaintManager.addDirtyRegion(Applet, int, int, int, int)` to avoid the use of the deprecated Applet API:

Before refactoring:
```java
import javax.swing.JApplet;
import javax.swing.RepaintManager;

public class MyJApplet extends JApplet {
    public void paint() {
        RepaintManager repaintManager = RepaintManager.currentManager(this);
        repaintManager.addDirtyRegion(this, 0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());
        // ... other painting code ...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
import javax.swing.JComponent;
import javax.swing.RepaintManager;

public class MyJComponent extends JComponent {
    public void paintComponent() {
        RepaintManager repaintManager = RepaintManager.currentManager(this);
        repaintManager.addDirtyRegion(this, 0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());
        // ... other painting code ...
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've changed the class from a JApplet to a JComponent and overridden the `paintComponent()` method instead of the deprecated `paint()` method. We've also updated the `addDirtyRegion()` call to use the current `JComponent` instance as the first argument instead of the deprecated `Applet` instance. This should allow the code to continue to work without relying on the deprecated Applet API.
