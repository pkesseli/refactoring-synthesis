Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `getViewportBorderBounds()` from `ScrollPaneLayout` to use the updated method from `JScrollPane`.

Before refactoring:

```java
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
ScrollPaneLayout layout = scrollPane.getViewportBorderBounds();
Rectangle bounds = layout.getViewportBorderBounds(scrollPane);

// Do something with bounds...
```

After refactoring:

```java
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
Rectangle bounds = scrollPane.getViewportBorderBounds();

// Do something with bounds...
```

As you can see, the refactored code is simpler and more concise, using only the updated method from `JScrollPane`. This will work for both older and newer versions of JDK, and will not trigger any deprecation warnings.
