Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `SwingUtilities.findFocusOwner(Component)` to use `KeyboardFocusManager.getFocusOwner()` instead:

Before:

```java
import javax.swing.SwingUtilities;
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
    public void doSomething() {
        Component focusOwner = SwingUtilities.findFocusOwner(this);
        // ... do something with focusOwner
    }
}
```

After:

```java
import java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager;
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
    public void doSomething() {
        KeyboardFocusManager focusManager = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager();
        Component focusOwner = focusManager.getFocusOwner();
        // ... do something with focusOwner
    }
}
```

In this example, we're replacing the deprecated `SwingUtilities.findFocusOwner(Component)` method with the non-deprecated `KeyboardFocusManager.getFocusOwner()` method. We're also using `KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager()` to get the `KeyboardFocusManager` instance.
