The `javax.swing.table.TableColumn.enableResizedPosting()` method was deprecated in Java 2 platform v1.3. The deprecation comment in Javadoc suggests that this method should not be used anymore. Instead, a new method should be used to replace the deprecated method.

Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the recommended method:

Before refactoring:

```java
TableColumn column = table.getColumnModel().getColumn(columnIndex);
column.enableResizedPosting();
```

After refactoring:

```java
TableColumn column = table.getColumnModel().getColumn(columnIndex);
column.setResizable(true);
```

In this refactoring example, the deprecated `enableResizedPosting()` method is replaced with the `setResizable(true)` method. This new method has the same functionality as the deprecated method, but it is not deprecated and can be used safely.
