Sure, here's an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated `modelToView(int)` method in `JTextComponent`:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();

// Get the bounds of the character at position 5 in the document
Rectangle bounds = textComponent.modelToView(5);
```

To refactor this code, we need to replace the deprecated `modelToView(int)` method with the recommended `modelToView2D(int)` method. Here's the refactored code:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();

// Get the bounds of the character at position 5 in the document
Shape shape = textComponent.modelToView2D(5);
Rectangle bounds = (shape instanceof Rectangle) ? (Rectangle) shape : shape.getBounds();
```

In the refactored code, we first call the `modelToView2D(int)` method to get the shape of the character at position 5 in the document. We then check if the shape is an instance of `Rectangle` (which it should be in most cases) and cast it to a `Rectangle`. Finally, we assign the `Rectangle` to the `bounds` variable.
