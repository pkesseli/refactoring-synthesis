Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.text.JTextComponent.viewToModel(Point)` method to use the replacement method `JTextComponent.viewToModel2D(Point2D)`:

Before refactoring:

```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();
Point point = new Point(50, 100);
int offset = textComponent.viewToModel(point);
```

After refactoring:

```
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();
Point2D point = new Point2D.Double(50, 100);
int offset = textComponent.viewToModel2D(point);
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `viewToModel(Point)` method with the replacement method `viewToModel2D(Point2D)`. To do this, we've created a new `Point2D` object using the `Double` class constructor and passing in the same `x` and `y` values as the original `Point` object. Then we pass this `Point2D` object to the `viewToModel2D` method to get the same result as the deprecated method.
