Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.mouseUp(Event, int, int)` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void mouseUp(Event evt, int x, int y) {
        // Do something when mouse is released
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void processMouseEvent(MouseEvent evt) {
        if (evt.getID() == MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED) {
            // Do something when mouse is released
        } else {
            super.processMouseEvent(evt);
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the `mouseUp` method with the `processMouseEvent` method, which is the recommended replacement according to the Javadoc. Inside `processMouseEvent`, we check if the event ID is `MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED`, which is equivalent to a mouse-up event. If it is, we perform the same logic that was originally in the `mouseUp` method. If the event is any other type of mouse event, we call the superclass implementation of `processMouseEvent` to handle it. This ensures that all other mouse events are still handled correctly.
