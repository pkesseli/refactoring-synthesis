Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `drawEchoCharacter(Graphics, int, int, char)` method to use the replacement `drawEchoCharacter(Graphics2D, float, float, char)` method:

Before refactoring:
```java
import javax.swing.text.PasswordView;

public class PasswordViewExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PasswordView passwordView = new PasswordView();
        passwordView.drawEchoCharacter(graphics, x, y, echoChar); // Deprecated method
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
import javax.swing.text.PasswordView;
import java.awt.Graphics2D;

public class PasswordViewExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PasswordView passwordView = new PasswordView();
        Graphics2D graphics2D = (Graphics2D) graphics; // Cast Graphics to Graphics2D
        passwordView.drawEchoCharacter(graphics2D, x, y, echoChar); // Replacement method
    }
}
```

In this example, we first import the `Graphics2D` class, which is required by the replacement method. We then cast the `Graphics` object to a `Graphics2D` object, since the replacement method takes a `Graphics2D` object as its first argument. Finally, we call the replacement method with the new arguments.
