The method javax.swing.text.Utilities.getBreakLocationâ€‹(Segment, FontMetrics, int, int, TabExpander, int) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "replaced by
     Utilities.getBreakLocation(Segment, FontMetrics, float, float,
                              TabExpander, int)"
Show me a refactoring example.
