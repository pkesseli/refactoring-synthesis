Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `move` method to use the recommended `setLocation` method instead.

Before:

```java
Component myComponent = new Component();
myComponent.move(10, 10);
```

After:

```java
Component myComponent = new Component();
myComponent.setLocation(10, 10);
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the `move` method call with a call to the `setLocation` method, which achieves the same result but uses the recommended method instead.
