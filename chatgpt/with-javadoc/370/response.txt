Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `javax.swing.text.Utilities.getPositionAbove(JTextComponent, int, int)` to use the new replacement method `Utilities.getPositionAbove(JTextComponent, int, float)`.

Before:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
int pos = 10;
int x = 20;
int newPos = Utilities.getPositionAbove(textComponent, pos, x);
```

After:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
int pos = 10;
float x = 20.0f;
int newPos = Utilities.getPositionAbove(textComponent, pos, x);
```

As you can see, the only change that needs to be made is to replace the second argument, which was an integer representing the x-coordinate, with a float value.
