Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `Utilities.getPositionBelow(JTextComponent, int, int)` method to use the replacement `Utilities.getPositionBelow(JTextComponent, int, float)` method:

```java
// Old code using deprecated method
int nextPos = Utilities.getPositionBelow(textComponent, currPos, 1);

// Refactored code using replacement method
float nextY = textComponent.getUI().modelToView(textComponent, currPos, Position.Bias.Forward).getBounds().y + textComponent.getFontMetrics(textComponent.getFont()).getHeight();
int nextPos = Utilities.getPositionBelow(textComponent, currPos, nextY);
```

The above code calculates the position of the next line below the current position in a `JTextComponent`. The old code uses the deprecated method which takes an `int` parameter for the height of the next line. The replacement method takes a `float` parameter instead, which represents the vertical position of the next line.

To refactor the code, we first need to calculate the vertical position of the next line using the `modelToView` method of the text component's UI. This method takes a position in the document and returns a rectangle representing the bounding box of the corresponding view in the text component. We then get the Y coordinate of the bounding box and add the height of the current font to get the vertical position of the next line.

We then pass this `nextY` value as a `float` parameter to the replacement method `Utilities.getPositionBelow(JTextComponent, int, float)` to get the position of the next line as an `int` value.

By refactoring the code in this way, we have replaced the usage of the deprecated method with the recommended replacement method.
