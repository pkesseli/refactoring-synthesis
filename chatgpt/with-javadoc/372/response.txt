Sure! Here is an example of how you can refactor the deprecated method `javax.swing.text.Utilities.getTabbedTextOffsetâ€‹()` to use the replacement method `Utilities.getTabbedTextOffset()`:

```java
// Before refactoring
int offset = Utilities.getTabbedTextOffset(segment, fm, x, tabBase, expander, startOffset);

// After refactoring
float[] tabStops = { tabBase };
float nextTabStop = tabBase;
int offset = Utilities.getTabbedTextOffset(segment, fm, x, nextTabStop, expander, startOffset, false);
```

In the refactored code, we are using the new version of the `Utilities.getTabbedTextOffset()` method, which takes two additional arguments: `float` values for the `tabBase` and `nextTabStop` parameters, and a `boolean` argument for the `expandTabs` parameter.

In this example, we are setting `tabStops` to an array containing only one element, which is the value of `tabBase`. We are also setting `nextTabStop` to the same value as `tabBase`.

By passing `false` for the `expandTabs` parameter, we are telling the method to use the `tabStops` array to determine the tab stops, rather than expanding the tabs to the next tab stop.

Overall, the refactored code should function the same as the original code using the deprecated method, but using the new method that is not deprecated.
