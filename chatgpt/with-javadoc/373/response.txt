Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the new method signature:

Before refactoring:

```java
FontMetrics fm = getFontMetrics(getFont());
int x = Utilities.getTabbedTextOffset(segment, fm, 0, pos, this, TAB_SIZE, false);
```

After refactoring:

```java
FontMetrics fm = getFontMetrics(getFont());
float x = Utilities.getTabbedTextOffset(segment, fm, 0f, (float)pos, this, TAB_SIZE, false);
```

As you can see, the only change is in the second parameter of the `getTabbedTextOffset()` method. Instead of passing an `int` for the `pos` parameter, we cast it to a `float` and pass it as the second argument to the new method. The same goes for the third parameter, which is also now a `float`.

This should resolve the deprecation warning while still keeping the functionality intact. Note that you may need to make similar changes in other parts of your code if you're using this method in multiple places.
