Sure, I'd be happy to show you an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `javax.swing.text.View.modelToView(int, Shape)`.

Let's say you have the following code snippet that uses the `modelToView` method:

```
JTextPane textPane = new JTextPane();
StyledDocument doc = textPane.getStyledDocument();
View rootView = textPane.getUI().getRootView(textPane);
Rectangle rect = textPane.getVisibleRect();
int pos = textPane.getCaretPosition();
Shape modelToView = rootView.modelToView(pos, rect);
```

To refactor this code, you can replace the `modelToView` method with the recommended replacement method, `modelToView2D`. Here's an example of how you could do that:

```
JTextPane textPane = new JTextPane();
StyledDocument doc = textPane.getStyledDocument();
View rootView = textPane.getUI().getRootView(textPane);
Rectangle rect = textPane.getVisibleRect();
int pos = textPane.getCaretPosition();
Rectangle2D modelToView = rootView.modelToView2D(pos);
Shape modelToViewShape = rootView.modelToView(pos, Position.Bias.Forward, pos, Position.Bias.Backward, rect);
```

In the refactored code, we're using the `modelToView2D` method to get a `Rectangle2D` object representing the bounds of the given position in the view coordinate system. We then use the `modelToView` method with `Position.Bias` parameters to get a `Shape` object representing the exact shape of the region that contains the given position in the view coordinate system.

Note that we're using `Position.Bias.Forward` and `Position.Bias.Backward` to specify the range of the region that we want to retrieve the shape for. You may need to adjust these parameters depending on your specific use case.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
