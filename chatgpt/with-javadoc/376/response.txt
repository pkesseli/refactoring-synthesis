Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated method `javax.swing.text.View.viewToModelâ€‹(float, float, Shape)`:

Deprecated Method:
```java
public int viewToModel(float x, float y, Shape a) {
    // implementation details
}
```

Refactored Method:
```java
public int viewToModel(JTextComponent textComponent, float x, float y) {
    Point2D.Float point = new Point2D.Float(x, y);
    int pos = -1;

    if (textComponent != null && textComponent.getDocument() != null) {
        View view = textComponent.getUI().getRootView(textComponent);
        if (view != null) {
            view.setSize(textComponent.getSize());
            Shape shape = view.modelToView(0, Position.Bias.Forward, view.model.getEndOffset());
            if (shape != null && shape.contains(point)) {
                pos = view.viewToModel(x, y, shape.getBounds());
            }
        }
    }

    return pos;
}
```

Explanation:

The deprecated `viewToModel` method took a `float x` and `float y` position relative to the view, and a `Shape` object that represents the bounds of the view. The refactored method takes a `JTextComponent` object, and `float x` and `float y` positions relative to the view.

The refactored method uses the `getRootView()` method of the `JTextComponent`'s UI to get the root view of the text component, and then sets its size to the size of the text component.

It then uses the `modelToView()` method of the view to get a `Shape` object that represents the bounds of the view. If the point `(x, y)` is contained within the shape, it uses the `viewToModel()` method of the view to convert the view coordinates to model coordinates and returns the resulting position.

Note that the refactored method assumes that the text component has a valid document. It also assumes that the view returned by `getRootView()` is a `javax.swing.text.View` object. If the text component uses a custom UI that returns a non-standard view object, the method may need to be modified accordingly.
