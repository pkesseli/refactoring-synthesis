Sure! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `nextFocus()` method to use the suggested replacement `transferFocus()` method:

Before refactoring:
```java
Component nextFocusableComponent = someComponent.nextFocus();
if (nextFocusableComponent != null) {
    nextFocusableComponent.requestFocus();
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
someComponent.transferFocus();
```

As you can see, the `nextFocus()` method has been replaced with the `transferFocus()` method, which accomplishes the same functionality but is not deprecated. The call to `requestFocus()` has also been removed, as the `transferFocus()` method automatically transfers focus to the next focusable component.
