Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `DefaultTreeSelectionModel.notifyPathChange` method.

Instead of using the deprecated method, you can use the `DefaultTreeSelectionModel.setSelectionPath` method to update the selected paths of the tree selection model. Here is an example:

```
// Old code using deprecated method
Vector<TreePath> paths = new Vector<>();
paths.add(someTreePath);
treeSelectionModel.notifyPathChange(paths, someTreePath);

// Refactored code using new method
treeSelectionModel.setSelectionPath(someTreePath);
```

In the refactored code, we simply call the `setSelectionPath` method of the tree selection model with the `TreePath` we want to select. This replaces the old code that used the deprecated `notifyPathChange` method.

Note that you can also use the `DefaultTreeSelectionModel.setSelectionPaths` method to set multiple selected paths at once, instead of just one path.
