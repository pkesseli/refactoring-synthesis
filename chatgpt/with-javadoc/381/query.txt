The method javax.tools.StandardJavaFileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromPathsâ€‹(Iterable&lt;? extends Path&gt;) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "use StandardJavaFileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromPaths(Collection) instead,
 to prevent the possibility of accidentally calling the method with a
 single Path as such an argument. Although Path implements
 Iterable<Path>, it would almost never be correct to pass a single
 Path and have it be treated as an Iterable of its
 components."
Show me a refactoring example.
