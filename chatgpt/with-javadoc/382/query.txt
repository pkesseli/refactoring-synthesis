The method javax.tools.ToolProvider.getSystemToolClassLoader() is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method is subject to removal in a future version of
 Java SE.
 Use the system tool provider or
 service loader mechanisms to
 locate system tools as well as user-installed tools."
Show me a refactoring example.
