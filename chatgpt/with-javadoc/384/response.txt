Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `newInstance` method to use the new `newFactory` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```
import javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException;

public class MyParser {
    private XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance("javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory",
            ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader());
    
    public void parse(String xml) throws XMLStreamException {
        // use factory to create XMLStreamReader and parse XML
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException;

public class MyParser {
    private XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newFactory("javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory",
            ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader());
    
    public void parse(String xml) throws XMLStreamException {
        // use factory to create XMLStreamReader and parse XML
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change that needs to be made is to replace the `newInstance` method with the `newFactory` method. The `newFactory` method has the same signature as the `newInstance` method, so the arguments passed to it can remain the same. The behavior of the code remains unchanged.
