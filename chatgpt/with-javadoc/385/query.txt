The method javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory.newInstanceâ€‹(String, ClassLoader) is deprecated. The related deprecation comment in Javadoc is "This method has been deprecated because it returns an
              instance of XMLInputFactory, which is of the wrong class.
              Use the new method XMLOutputFactory.newFactory(java.lang.String,
              java.lang.ClassLoader) instead."
Show me a refactoring example.
