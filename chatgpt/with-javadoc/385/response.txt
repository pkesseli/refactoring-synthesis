Sure! Here is an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory.newInstanceâ€‹(String, ClassLoader)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    XMLOutputFactory factory = XMLOutputFactory.newInstance("javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory", null);
    // ...
  }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    XMLOutputFactory factory = XMLOutputFactory.newFactory("javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory", null);
    // ...
  }
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the deprecated method `XMLOutputFactory.newInstance(String, ClassLoader)` with the recommended method `XMLOutputFactory.newFactory(String, ClassLoader)`.
