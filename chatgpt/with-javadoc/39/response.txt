Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `postEvent` method in Java's `Component` class to use the `dispatchEvent` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void someMethod() {
        Event e = new Event(this, Event.MOUSE_DOWN, new Integer(1), new Integer(2));
        postEvent(e);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void someMethod() {
        Event e = new Event(this, Event.MOUSE_DOWN, new Integer(1), new Integer(2));
        dispatchEvent(e);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the call to `postEvent` with `dispatchEvent`. This should ensure that your code continues to work as expected without using deprecated methods.
