Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `preferredSize()` method to use the recommended `getPreferredSize()` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public Dimension preferredSize() {
        // Compute and return the preferred size of this component
        // ...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    @Override
    public Dimension getPreferredSize() {
        // Compute and return the preferred size of this component
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have simply renamed the `preferredSize()` method to `getPreferredSize()`, and added the `@Override` annotation to indicate that we are overriding a method from a superclass or interface.

By using `getPreferredSize()` instead of `preferredSize()`, we can ensure that our code will continue to work correctly with newer versions of Java, even as the `preferredSize()` method becomes increasingly outdated.
