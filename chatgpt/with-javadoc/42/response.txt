Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `resize()` to use `setSize()` instead:

Before:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    
    public void resize(int width, int height) {
        super.resize(width, height);
        // additional code here
    }
}
```

After:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    
    public void setSize(int width, int height) {
        super.setSize(width, height);
        // additional code here
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the method call `resize()` with `setSize()`. This is because `resize()` has been deprecated and replaced by `setSize()` in JDK 1.1.
