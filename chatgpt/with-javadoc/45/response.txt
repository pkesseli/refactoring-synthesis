Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `show(boolean)` to use `setVisible(boolean)` instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
Component myComponent = new MyComponent();
myComponent.show(true);
```

After refactoring:

```java
Component myComponent = new MyComponent();
myComponent.setVisible(true);
```

By simply replacing the deprecated `show(boolean)` method with `setVisible(boolean)`, the code now uses the preferred method for showing or hiding a component.
