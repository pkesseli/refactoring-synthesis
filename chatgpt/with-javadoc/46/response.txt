Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.size()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyClass {
    public void doSomething(Component comp) {
        int width = comp.size().width;
        int height = comp.size().height;
        // do something with width and height
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class MyClass {
    public void doSomething(Component comp) {
        Dimension size = comp.getSize();
        int width = size.width;
        int height = size.height;
        // do something with width and height
    }
}
```

In this example, we replace the deprecated `size()` method with the recommended `getSize()` method. We also update the variable assignments to use the `Dimension` object returned by `getSize()`. This ensures that the code is using up-to-date and supported methods, and will continue to work properly in future versions of Java.
