Sure! Here is an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `getOrientation(ResourceBundle)` method to use the recommended `getOrientation(Locale)` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("com.example.myapp.resources.MyBundle");
ComponentOrientation orientation = ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(bundle);
```

After refactoring:

```java
Locale locale = Locale.getDefault(); // or specify a specific locale here
ComponentOrientation orientation = ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(locale);
```

In the refactored code, we first obtain the desired `Locale`, either by using the default locale or by specifying a specific locale. Then, we use the `getOrientation(Locale)` method to obtain the appropriate `ComponentOrientation` object.

Note that in some cases, you may need to modify the code further to ensure that the `Locale` object you use is appropriate for the context in which your code is running. For example, you may need to use a different `Locale` when running on a different operating system or when interacting with users who speak a different language.
