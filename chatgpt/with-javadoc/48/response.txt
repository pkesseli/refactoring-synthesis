Sure, here's an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated `countComponents()` method to instead use `getComponentCount()`:

Before refactoring:

```
import java.awt.Container;

public class MyContainer extends Container {
    
    public void printComponentCount() {
        System.out.println("Number of components: " + countComponents());
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import java.awt.Container;

public class MyContainer extends Container {
    
    public void printComponentCount() {
        System.out.println("Number of components: " + getComponentCount());
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change that was necessary was to replace the call to `countComponents()` with a call to `getComponentCount()`. This ensures that the code continues to work as expected, while avoiding the use of a deprecated method.
