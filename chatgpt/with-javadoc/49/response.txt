Sure, here's an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `deliverEvent(Event)` method with `dispatchEvent(AWTEvent e)` in Java:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Container;
import java.awt.Event;

public class MyContainer extends Container {
    
    public boolean handleEvent(Event evt) {
        if (evt.id == Event.MOUSE_DOWN) {
            deliverEvent(evt); // deprecated method
            return true;
        }
        return super.handleEvent(evt);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Container;
import java.awt.AWTEvent;

public class MyContainer extends Container {
    
    public boolean handleEvent(AWTEvent evt) {
        if (evt.getID() == AWTEvent.MOUSE_EVENT_MASK) {
            dispatchEvent(evt); // updated method
            return true;
        }
        return super.handleEvent(evt);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the `deliverEvent(Event)` method has been replaced with the newer `dispatchEvent(AWTEvent e)` method, as recommended by the deprecation comment in the Javadoc. Additionally, the `Event` class has been replaced with the more general `AWTEvent` class, which is the superclass of all AWT events. Finally, the `id` field of the `Event` class has been replaced with the `getID()` method of the `AWTEvent` class.
