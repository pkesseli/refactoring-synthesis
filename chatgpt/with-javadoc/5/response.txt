Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `getExpression()` method to use the recommended `getExpressions()` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```
CaseTree caseTree = ...;
ExpressionTree expressionTree = caseTree.getExpression();
```

After refactoring:

```
CaseTree caseTree = ...;
List<? extends ExpressionTree> expressions = caseTree.getExpressions();
ExpressionTree expressionTree = expressions.get(0); // Use the first expression in the list
```

In the example above, we first get a `CaseTree` instance and then use the deprecated `getExpression()` method to retrieve the expression associated with the case. We then refactor the code by replacing the deprecated method call with the recommended `getExpressions()` method, which returns a list of expressions associated with the case. We can then use the `get()` method to retrieve the desired expression from the list. In this case, we are using the first expression in the list, but you can modify the code to use any expression in the list as needed.
