Sure, here is an example of how you could refactor your code to use the non-deprecated method `getInsets()` instead of the deprecated method `insets()`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyPanel extends Panel {
    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        // Use deprecated insets() method
        Insets insets = insets();
        int x = insets.left;
        int y = insets.top;
        int width = getWidth() - insets.left - insets.right;
        int height = getHeight() - insets.top - insets.bottom;
        g.drawRect(x, y, width, height);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyPanel extends Panel {
    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        // Use non-deprecated getInsets() method
        Insets insets = getInsets();
        int x = insets.left;
        int y = insets.top;
        int width = getWidth() - insets.left - insets.right;
        int height = getHeight() - insets.top - insets.bottom;
        g.drawRect(x, y, width, height);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the call to `insets()` with a call to `getInsets()`. This will ensure that your code continues to work correctly with newer versions of Java, which no longer support the deprecated `insets()` method.
