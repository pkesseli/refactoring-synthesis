Sure! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Container.locate(int, int)` method:

```java
Container container = // obtain a reference to a container object
int x = 100;
int y = 200;
Component component = container.locate(x, y);
```

To refactor this code, we need to replace the `Container.locate(int, int)` method with its replacement, `Container.getComponentAt(int, int)`. Here's the refactored code:

```java
Container container = // obtain a reference to a container object
int x = 100;
int y = 200;
Component component = container.getComponentAt(x, y);
```

As you can see, the only change is to replace the `locate` method call with `getComponentAt`. This will ensure that the code continues to work correctly without relying on deprecated functionality.
