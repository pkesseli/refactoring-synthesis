Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to remove the usage of the deprecated `normalizeMimeType` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
String mimeType = "text/plain";
String normalizedMimeType = DataFlavor.normalizeMimeType(mimeType);
DataFlavor dataFlavor = new DataFlavor(normalizedMimeType);
```

After refactoring:

```java
String mimeType = "text/plain";
DataFlavor dataFlavor = new DataFlavor(mimeType);
```

Explanation:

Since the deprecation comment states that the `normalizeMimeType` method is never invoked from 1.1 onwards, you can safely remove the call to this method and pass the original `mimeType` string directly to the `DataFlavor` constructor.

Note: If you have code that explicitly depends on the behavior of the deprecated `normalizeMimeType` method, you should consider replacing it with an alternative implementation or a different API altogether.
