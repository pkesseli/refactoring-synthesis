Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Dialog.hide()` method to use `setVisible(boolean)` instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
Dialog dialog = new Dialog(parent, "My Dialog", true);
dialog.hide(); // deprecated method
```

After refactoring:

```java
Dialog dialog = new Dialog(parent, "My Dialog", true);
dialog.setVisible(false); // use setVisible(boolean) instead
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the call to `hide()` with a call to `setVisible(false)`, as suggested by the deprecation comment in the Javadoc. This change ensures that the code will continue to work properly even if the `hide()` method is removed in a future version of Java.
