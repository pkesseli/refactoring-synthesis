Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor a code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Dialog.show()` method to use the recommended `setVisible(boolean)` method instead:

Before:

```java
import java.awt.Dialog;

public class MyDialog extends Dialog {
    
    public MyDialog(Frame parent) {
        super(parent);
    }
    
    public void showDialog() {
        // Do something before showing dialog
        show();
        // Do something after showing dialog
    }
    
}
```

After:

```java
import java.awt.Dialog;

public class MyDialog extends Dialog {
    
    public MyDialog(Frame parent) {
        super(parent);
    }
    
    public void showDialog() {
        // Do something before showing dialog
        setVisible(true);
        // Do something after showing dialog
    }
    
}
```

As you can see, the only change necessary was to replace the call to `show()` with `setVisible(true)`. This change should have no impact on the behavior of the code, as the two methods perform the same action.
