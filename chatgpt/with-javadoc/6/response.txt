Sure, here's an example refactoring that addresses the deprecation of `java.awt.AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass(Class<?> subClass)`.

Before the refactoring, suppose we have a class called `CustomAWTKeyStroke` that extends `AWTKeyStroke` and we register it using the deprecated `registerSubclass` method:

```java
public class CustomAWTKeyStroke extends AWTKeyStroke {
    // ... implementation details ...
}

CustomAWTKeyStroke customKeyStroke = new CustomAWTKeyStroke(keyCode, modifiers);
AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass(CustomAWTKeyStroke.class);
```

After the refactoring, we should use `java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager.registerKeyEventDispatcher` to achieve the same result without using the deprecated `registerSubclass` method:

```java
public class CustomAWTKeyStroke extends AWTKeyStroke {
    // ... implementation details ...
}

CustomAWTKeyStroke customKeyStroke = new CustomAWTKeyStroke(keyCode, modifiers);
KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager().addKeyEventDispatcher(
    new KeyEventDispatcher() {
        public boolean dispatchKeyEvent(KeyEvent e) {
            if (customKeyStroke.equals(AWTKeyStroke.getAWTKeyStrokeForEvent(e))) {
                // handle the event
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
);
```

In this refactored code, we create an anonymous inner class that implements `KeyEventDispatcher`, which is responsible for dispatching key events to the registered components. In the implementation of `dispatchKeyEvent`, we check whether the received key event matches our custom key stroke by comparing it to the result of `AWTKeyStroke.getAWTKeyStrokeForEvent(e)`. If it matches, we handle the event and return `true`, indicating that the event was consumed. If it doesn't match, we return `false`, indicating that the event should be passed on to the next dispatcher in the chain.

By using `addKeyEventDispatcher` instead of `registerSubclass`, we can achieve the same functionality without relying on a deprecated method.
