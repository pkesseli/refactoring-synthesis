Sure! Here's an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `getModifiers()` method with `getModifiersEx()`:

```java
// Before refactoring
if (event.getModifiers() == InputEvent.SHIFT_MASK) {
    // Handle shift key pressed
}

// After refactoring
if ((event.getModifiersEx() & InputEvent.SHIFT_DOWN_MASK) != 0) {
    // Handle shift key pressed
}
```

In the example above, we are checking whether the shift key is pressed during an `InputEvent` by using the `getModifiers()` method. However, since this method is deprecated, we can refactor the code to use `getModifiersEx()` instead, as recommended by the deprecation comment. 

In the refactored code, we use the `&` operator to check if the `SHIFT_DOWN_MASK` bit is set in the `modifiersEx` value returned by `getModifiersEx()`. This is equivalent to checking if the `SHIFT_MASK` bit is set in the old `getModifiers()` method. 

By using `getModifiersEx()`, we can also check for extended modifier keys like `ALT_GRAPH_DOWN_MASK` and `BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK`, which were not supported by the old `getModifiers()` method.
