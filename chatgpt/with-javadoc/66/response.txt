Sure! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `finalize()` method in Java:

```java
class MyClass {
   // ... constructor and other methods ...
   
   protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
       // Perform some cleanup tasks here
       super.finalize();
   }
}
```

To refactor this code, you should first identify what cleanup tasks need to be performed and find alternative mechanisms for performing them. For example, if the cleanup tasks involve closing resources like file handles, database connections, or network sockets, you can use the try-with-resources statement to automatically close these resources when they are no longer needed.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the code above using the try-with-resources statement:

```java
class MyClass {
   // ... constructor and other methods ...
   
   void doSomeTask() {
       try (Resource1 res1 = new Resource1(); Resource2 res2 = new Resource2()) {
           // Perform some task that uses the resources
       } catch (Exception e) {
           // Handle exceptions here
       }
   }
}
```

In this refactored code, `Resource1` and `Resource2` are the classes that represent the resources that need to be cleaned up. The try-with-resources statement will automatically close these resources when the block of code is finished, whether or not an exception is thrown. This makes the code simpler and safer than relying on the `finalize()` method.

Remember, the key to refactoring code that uses deprecated methods is to find alternative mechanisms for performing the same functionality. In this example, we used the try-with-resources statement, but there may be other mechanisms that are more appropriate for your particular use case.
