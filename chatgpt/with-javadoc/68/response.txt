Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `java.awt.image.ColorModel.finalize()` method:

Before refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.image.ColorModel;

public class ColorModelExample {
    private ColorModel colorModel;

    public ColorModelExample() {
        colorModel = new ColorModel();
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // Perform cleanup
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.image.ColorModel;

public class ColorModelExample {
    private ColorModel colorModel;

    public ColorModelExample() {
        colorModel = new ColorModel();
    }

    public void cleanUp() {
        // Perform cleanup
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the `finalize()` method has been removed and replaced with a new method called `cleanUp()`. The cleanup code that was originally in `finalize()` has been moved to this new method. 

You would need to make sure that you call the `cleanUp()` method manually before the object goes out of scope. This can be done by adding a `finally` block to the code that creates and uses the `ColorModelExample` object.

For example:
```java
ColorModelExample example = null;
try {
    example = new ColorModelExample();
    // Do some work with example
} finally {
    if (example != null) {
        example.cleanUp();
    }
}
``` 

This way, you are ensuring that the cleanup code is executed even if an exception occurs during the execution of the code.
