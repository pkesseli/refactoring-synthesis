Sure! Here's an example refactoring in Java that replaces the deprecated `concetenateTransform` method with the `concatenateTransform` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
RenderContext renderContext = new RenderContext(transform);
renderContext.concetenateTransform(new AffineTransform(scale, shear, shear, scale, dx, dy));
```

After refactoring:

```java
RenderContext renderContext = new RenderContext(transform);
renderContext.concatenateTransform(new AffineTransform(scale, shear, shear, scale, dx, dy));
```

In the refactored code, the `concetenateTransform` method is replaced with the correct `concatenateTransform` method, as suggested in the Javadoc deprecation comment. This ensures that the code is using the updated method and will not be impacted by any future changes or removal of the deprecated method.
