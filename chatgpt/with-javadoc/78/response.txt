Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `java.awt.List.delItems(int, int)` to remove the deprecation warning and use a non-deprecated alternative:

Before:
```java
import java.awt.List;

public class MyList extends List {
  
  public void removeItems(int start, int end) {
    delItems(start, end);
  }
}
```

After:
```java
import java.awt.List;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MyList extends List {
  
  public void removeItems(int start, int end) {
    int[] selected = getSelectedIndexes();
    int[] toRemove = Arrays.copyOfRange(selected, start, end + 1);
    for (int i : toRemove) {
      deselect(i);
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we are replacing the use of the deprecated `delItems` method with an alternative implementation that uses `getSelectedIndexes` and `deselect` methods. The `getSelectedIndexes` method returns an array of integers representing the indexes of the selected items in the list, and `deselect` method deselects the item at the specified index. 

We use the `Arrays.copyOfRange` method to get a subarray of the selected items between the start and end indices, inclusive, and then iterate over that subarray to deselect each item.

Note that this is just one example of how you could refactor code that uses the `delItems` method. The specific refactoring you choose will depend on the specifics of your code and what alternative methods are available.
