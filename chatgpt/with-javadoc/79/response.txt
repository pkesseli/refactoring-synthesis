Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.List.isSelected(int)` method to use the replacement method `isIndexSelected(int)`:

```java
// Before refactoring
List myList = new List();
int selectedIndex = myList.getSelectedIndex();
boolean isSelected = myList.isSelected(selectedIndex);
System.out.println("Selected item is: " + myList.getItem(selectedIndex));
System.out.println("Is selected: " + isSelected);

// After refactoring
List myList = new List();
int selectedIndex = myList.getSelectedIndex();
boolean isSelected = myList.isIndexSelected(selectedIndex);
System.out.println("Selected item is: " + myList.getItem(selectedIndex));
System.out.println("Is selected: " + isSelected);
```

In this example, we simply replaced the deprecated method `isSelected(int)` with the replacement method `isIndexSelected(int)`. The code now uses the recommended method and should continue to work as expected.
