Sure! Here is an example of how to refactor the `minimumSize(int)` method to use `getMinimumSize(int)` instead, in Java:

Before refactoring:

```
import java.awt.List;

public class MyList extends List {
    public MyList(int numRows, boolean multipleMode) {
        super(numRows, multipleMode);
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        int minSize = minimumSize(10);
        // Do something with minSize...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import java.awt.List;

public class MyList extends List {
    public MyList(int numRows, boolean multipleMode) {
        super(numRows, multipleMode);
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        int minSize = getMinimumSize(10);
        // Do something with minSize...
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change is to replace the call to the `minimumSize(int)` method with a call to `getMinimumSize(int)`. This ensures that your code will continue to work as expected, even as new versions of Java are released.
