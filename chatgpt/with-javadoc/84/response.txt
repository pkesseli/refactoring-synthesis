Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `setMultipleSelections(boolean)` method in `java.awt.List`:

Before Refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.List;

public class MyList {
    private List list;
    
    public MyList() {
        list = new List();
        list.setMultipleSelections(true);
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:
```java
import java.awt.List;

public class MyList {
    private List list;
    
    public MyList() {
        list = new List();
        list.setMultipleMode(List.MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `setMultipleSelections(boolean)` method with the `setMultipleMode(int)` method, which takes an integer constant as its argument to specify the type of multiple selection mode. In this case, we use the `List.MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION` constant to enable multiple selection mode. 

Note that this code assumes that the `List` object should allow selecting multiple items at once, which was the behavior of the original code. If you want to change the selection mode to something else, you would need to adjust the argument passed to `setMultipleMode(int)` accordingly.
