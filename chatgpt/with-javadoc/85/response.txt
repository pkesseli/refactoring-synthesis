Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `countItems()` method in favor of the recommended `getItemCount()` method:

Before refactoring:

```
Menu myMenu = new Menu("File");
int numOfItems = myMenu.countItems();
```

After refactoring:

```
Menu myMenu = new Menu("File");
int numOfItems = myMenu.getItemCount();
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `countItems()` method with the recommended `getItemCount()` method, which serves the same purpose. This ensures that the code continues to function as intended while using up-to-date and supported methods.
