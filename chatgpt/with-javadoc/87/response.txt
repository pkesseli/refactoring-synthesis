Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor the use of the deprecated `java.awt.MenuComponent.postEvent(Event)` method to use the recommended `dispatchEvent()` method instead.

Before:

```java
Event event = new Event(source, id, arg);
menuComponent.postEvent(event);
```

After:

```java
Event event = new Event(source, id, arg);
menuComponent.dispatchEvent(event);
```

In this example, we simply replace the call to `postEvent()` with a call to `dispatchEvent()`. This ensures that we are using the recommended method and avoids any potential issues that could arise from using a deprecated method.
