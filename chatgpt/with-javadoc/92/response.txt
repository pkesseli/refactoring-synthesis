Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `getBoundingBox()` method to use the recommended `getBounds()` method:

Before Refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Polygon;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Polygon polygon = new Polygon(new int[] {0, 10, 20}, new int[] {0, 20, 10}, 3);
        // Get the bounding box
        java.awt.Rectangle boundingBox = polygon.getBoundingBox();
        System.out.println("Bounding box: " + boundingBox);
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Polygon;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Polygon polygon = new Polygon(new int[] {0, 10, 20}, new int[] {0, 20, 10}, 3);
        // Get the bounds
        java.awt.Rectangle bounds = polygon.getBounds();
        System.out.println("Bounds: " + bounds);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed was to replace the `getBoundingBox()` method with `getBounds()`. This ensures that the code will continue to work correctly even as new versions of Java are released.
