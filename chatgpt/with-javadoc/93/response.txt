Sure, here is an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `inside` method of the `java.awt.Polygon` class to use the recommended `contains` method instead:

Before refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Polygon;

public class PolygonDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Polygon polygon = new Polygon(new int[]{100, 200, 300}, new int[]{200, 100, 200}, 3);
        boolean inside = polygon.inside(150, 150); // using deprecated inside method
        System.out.println("Point is inside polygon: " + inside);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```
import java.awt.Polygon;

public class PolygonDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Polygon polygon = new Polygon(new int[]{100, 200, 300}, new int[]{200, 100, 200}, 3);
        boolean contains = polygon.contains(150, 150); // using recommended contains method
        System.out.println("Point is inside polygon: " + contains);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change made to the code is to replace the deprecated `inside` method with the recommended `contains` method. This ensures that the code will continue to work correctly with future versions of Java.
