Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated method `java.awt.Rectangle.inside(int, int)`:

```
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100);
if(rect.inside(x, y)) {
    System.out.println("Point is inside rectangle");
}
```

To refactor this code, we need to replace the usage of `inside(int, int)` with the recommended method `contains(int, int)`:

```
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100);
if(rect.contains(x, y)) {
    System.out.println("Point is inside rectangle");
}
```

As you can see, the code remains functionally equivalent, but now uses the non-deprecated method `contains(int, int)` instead of `inside(int, int)`. This helps ensure that the code remains compatible with future versions of Java, which may remove the deprecated method entirely.
