Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the non-deprecated `setLocation` method instead of the deprecated `move` method in Java:

Before Refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 20, 20);
        rect.move(30, 30);
        System.out.println("New position: (" + rect.x + ", " + rect.y + ")");
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 20, 20);
        rect.setLocation(30, 30);
        System.out.println("New position: (" + rect.x + ", " + rect.y + ")");
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example, we replaced the deprecated `move` method with the non-deprecated `setLocation` method. The `setLocation` method takes two arguments, the new x and y coordinates for the rectangle. We can then retrieve the new x and y coordinates of the rectangle using the `x` and `y` fields of the `Rectangle` class respectively.
