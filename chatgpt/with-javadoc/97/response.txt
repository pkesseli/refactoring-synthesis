Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor your code to replace the deprecated `reshape` method with the `setBounds` method in Java:

Before refactoring:
```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 50, 50);
rect.reshape(20, 20, 60, 60);
```

After refactoring:
```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 50, 50);
rect.setBounds(20, 20, 60, 60);
```

In this example, we've simply replaced the call to the `reshape` method with a call to the `setBounds` method, which provides the same functionality but is not deprecated. The `setBounds` method sets the bounds of the rectangle to the specified values, effectively moving and resizing it as necessary.
