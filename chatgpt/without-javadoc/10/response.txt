Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.CheckboxGroup.setCurrentâ€‹(Checkbox)` method.

Deprecated methods are marked as such because they are either no longer necessary, have been replaced by newer methods, or are no longer recommended for use due to security or other issues. In this case, the `setCurrent` method has been deprecated because it can be misused and cause unexpected behavior.

To refactor code that uses `setCurrent`, you should instead use the `CheckboxGroup.setSelectedCheckbox` method. This method takes a `Checkbox` object as its argument and sets it as the currently selected checkbox in the group.

Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses `setCurrent`:

Before:

```
CheckboxGroup group = new CheckboxGroup();
Checkbox checkbox1 = new Checkbox("Option 1", group, true);
Checkbox checkbox2 = new Checkbox("Option 2", group, false);

// Select the second checkbox in the group
group.setCurrent(checkbox2);
```

After:

```
CheckboxGroup group = new CheckboxGroup();
Checkbox checkbox1 = new Checkbox("Option 1", group, true);
Checkbox checkbox2 = new Checkbox("Option 2", group, false);

// Select the second checkbox in the group
group.setSelectedCheckbox(checkbox2);
```

As you can see, the code is almost identical, but the deprecated method `setCurrent` has been replaced with `setSelectedCheckbox`. This ensures that the code will continue to function properly and avoid any unexpected behavior due to the deprecated method.
