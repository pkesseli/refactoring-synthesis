Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the use of the deprecated method `java.awt.TextArea.insertText(String, int)`:

Deprecated method:

```
java.awt.TextArea textArea = new java.awt.TextArea();
textArea.insertText("Hello, World!", 0);
```

Refactored code:

```
javax.swing.JTextArea textArea = new javax.swing.JTextArea();
textArea.insert("Hello, World!", 0);
```

In the refactored code, we're using `javax.swing.JTextArea` instead of `java.awt.TextArea` and we're using the non-deprecated method `insert(String, int)` instead of `insertText(String, int)`. Note that we also changed the import statement to import `javax.swing.JTextArea`.

This is just one example of how you can refactor the use of a deprecated method. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to use a different class or method altogether. It's important to read the documentation and understand the reasons why a method has been deprecated in order to make the appropriate changes.
