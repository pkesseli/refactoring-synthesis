Sure, I'd be happy to provide a refactoring example for the deprecated method `java.awt.TextArea.preferredSize()`. 

First, let's understand what deprecation means in Java. Deprecation is a warning to developers that a particular method, class, or interface is no longer recommended to be used in new code. Deprecated elements may still work, but they might be removed in a future release, so it's recommended to avoid using them in new code and look for alternative solutions.

In the case of `java.awt.TextArea.preferredSize()`, the preferred approach is to use the `java.awt.TextArea.getPreferredSize()` method instead, which returns the preferred size of the TextArea.

Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `preferredSize()` method:

```
// Old code using deprecated method
import java.awt.*;

public class MyPanel extends Panel {
    private TextArea myTextArea;

    public MyPanel() {
        myTextArea = new TextArea();
        Dimension size = myTextArea.preferredSize();
        setSize(size);
        add(myTextArea);
    }
}

// Refactored code using the recommended method
import java.awt.*;

public class MyPanel extends Panel {
    private TextArea myTextArea;

    public MyPanel() {
        myTextArea = new TextArea();
        Dimension size = myTextArea.getPreferredSize();
        setSize(size);
        add(myTextArea);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the `preferredSize()` method with `getPreferredSize()`. This ensures that the code is using the recommended approach and will continue to work even if the deprecated method is removed in a future release.
