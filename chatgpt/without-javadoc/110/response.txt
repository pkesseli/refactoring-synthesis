Sure, I can show you an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `java.awt.TextArea.preferredSize(int, int)`.

First, let's understand why this method is deprecated. According to the Java documentation, this method has been deprecated because it does not take into account the font and border of the TextArea, which can lead to incorrect sizing. The recommended approach is to use the `java.awt.TextArea.getPreferredSize()` method instead, which does take into account the font and border.

Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `preferredSize(int, int)` method:

```java
// Before refactoring:
import java.awt.Dimension;
import java.awt.TextArea;

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextArea textArea = new TextArea();
        Dimension preferredSize = textArea.preferredSize(400, 300);
        System.out.println("Preferred size: " + preferredSize);
    }
}

// After refactoring:
import java.awt.Dimension;
import java.awt.TextArea;

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextArea textArea = new TextArea();
        Dimension preferredSize = textArea.getPreferredSize();
        textArea.setSize(400, 300);
        System.out.println("Preferred size: " + preferredSize);
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `preferredSize(int, int)` method with the recommended `getPreferredSize()` method. We have also set the size of the TextArea using the `setSize()` method, which takes the width and height as parameters.

By using `getPreferredSize()` and setting the size explicitly, we can ensure that the TextArea is correctly sized taking into account its font and border.
