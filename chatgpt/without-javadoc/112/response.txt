Sure, here is an example refactoring using the deprecated method `java.awt.TextField.minimumSize()`:

Before refactoring:

```
import java.awt.*;

public class MyTextField extends TextField {

    public MyTextField() {
        super();
    }

    public Dimension minimumSize() {
        return new Dimension(100, 20);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import java.awt.*;

public class MyTextField extends TextField {

    public MyTextField() {
        super();
    }

    @Override
    public Dimension getMinimumSize() {
        return new Dimension(100, 20);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the method `minimumSize()` has been replaced with `getMinimumSize()`, which is the recommended method to use. Additionally, the `@Override` annotation has been added to indicate that this method overrides a method in the superclass. 

It's worth noting that `getMinimumSize()` is now part of the `java.awt.Component` class, so it should be used instead of the deprecated `minimumSize()` method.
