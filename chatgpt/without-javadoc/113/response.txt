Certainly! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.TextField.minimumSize(int)` method:

```java
import java.awt.TextField;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        textField.minimumSize(50);
        Dimension size = textField.getMinimumSize();
        System.out.println(size.width + "x" + size.height);
    }
    
}
```

In this example, the `TextField` object is created and then the deprecated `minimumSize` method is called to set the minimum width of the text field to 50 pixels. This method is deprecated, meaning that it is no longer recommended for use because it has been replaced by better alternatives. 

To refactor this code, we can replace the deprecated method with the `setMinimumSize` method, which sets both the minimum width and height of the text field:

```java
import java.awt.TextField;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        textField.setMinimumSize(new Dimension(50, textField.getPreferredSize().height));
        Dimension size = textField.getMinimumSize();
        System.out.println(size.width + "x" + size.height);
    }
    
}
```

In this refactored code, the `setMinimumSize` method is used to set the minimum size of the text field to a `Dimension` object that specifies a width of 50 pixels and a height equal to the preferred height of the text field. This way, we ensure that the minimum size is set correctly, without using the deprecated method.

Note that this refactored code assumes that the preferred height of the text field is suitable for the minimum height. If this is not the case, you can replace `textField.getPreferredSize().height` with a different value that represents the preferred height of the text field.
