Sure! The `setEchoCharacter(char)` method in the `java.awt.TextField` class is deprecated because it does not provide sufficient security when handling sensitive user input, such as passwords. Therefore, it is recommended to use a more secure alternative, such as `javax.swing.JPasswordField`.

Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `setEchoCharacter(char)` to use `JPasswordField` instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.TextField;

public class PasswordTextField extends TextField {
    
    public PasswordTextField(int columns) {
        super(columns);
        setEchoCharacter('*');
    }
    
    // other methods...
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.swing.JPasswordField;

public class PasswordField extends JPasswordField {
    
    public PasswordField(int columns) {
        super(columns);
    }
    
    // other methods...
}
```

As you can see, the refactored code replaces `java.awt.TextField` with `javax.swing.JPasswordField`, which is a more secure alternative that is designed specifically for handling password input. The `setEchoCharacter(char)` method is no longer needed because `JPasswordField` automatically masks the input with asterisks or bullets.

Note that you may need to make additional changes to your code, depending on how it uses the `TextField` class. For example, if you need to retrieve the password entered by the user, you will need to use the `getPassword()` method of `JPasswordField` instead of `getText()` method of `TextField`.
