Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `ICC_Profile.finalize()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.color.ICC_Profile;

public class Example {
    private ICC_Profile profile;
    
    public Example() {
        profile = ICC_Profile.getInstance("some_profile.icc");
    }
    
    // other methods here
    
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // perform cleanup
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.color.ICC_Profile;

public class Example {
    private ICC_Profile profile;
    
    public Example() {
        profile = ICC_Profile.getInstance("some_profile.icc");
        
        // Register the profile with a finalizer reference queue
        FinalizerReferenceQueue.getInstance().register(profile, new ProfileFinalizer(profile));
    }
    
    // other methods here
    
    private static class ProfileFinalizer implements Runnable {
        private final ICC_Profile profile;
        
        public ProfileFinalizer(ICC_Profile profile) {
            this.profile = profile;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            // perform cleanup
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, instead of overriding the `finalize()` method on the `Example` class, we register the `ICC_Profile` instance with a custom `FinalizerReferenceQueue` class. The `FinalizerReferenceQueue` class is responsible for running a cleanup method on the `ICC_Profile` instance when it is no longer referenced by the application.

The `ProfileFinalizer` class is a simple implementation of the `Runnable` interface that encapsulates the cleanup logic for the `ICC_Profile` instance. When the `FinalizerReferenceQueue` detects that the `ICC_Profile` instance is no longer referenced, it will call the `run()` method on the `ProfileFinalizer` instance, which will perform the necessary cleanup.

Note that this is just one possible refactoring strategy. Depending on the specifics of your application, you may need to use a different approach.
