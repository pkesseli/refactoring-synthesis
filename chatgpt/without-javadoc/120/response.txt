Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `applyResourceBundle` method in Java's `java.awt.Window` class:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Window;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;

public class ExampleWindow extends Window {
    public ExampleWindow() {
        String bundleName = "com.example.resources.ExampleResources";
        applyResourceBundle(bundleName);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Window;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;

public class ExampleWindow extends Window {
    public ExampleWindow() {
        String bundleName = "com.example.resources.ExampleResources";
        ResourceBundle resourceBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(bundleName);
        applyResourceBundle(resourceBundle);
    }
    
    private void applyResourceBundle(ResourceBundle resourceBundle) {
        // Implementation for applying the resource bundle to the window goes here
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `applyResourceBundle(String)` method with a new method `applyResourceBundle(ResourceBundle)` that takes a `ResourceBundle` object as its argument. Instead of passing a string with the resource bundle's name, we create a `ResourceBundle` object by calling the `ResourceBundle.getBundle(String)` method with the bundle's name. Then, we call the new `applyResourceBundle(ResourceBundle)` method, passing in the `ResourceBundle` object we just created.

Note that the implementation of the `applyResourceBundle(ResourceBundle)` method is not shown here, as it will depend on the specific behavior that the original code was trying to achieve. You will need to implement this method based on your application's needs.
