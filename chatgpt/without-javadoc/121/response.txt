Sure, I can give you an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `java.awt.Window.applyResourceBundle(ResourceBundle)`.

The `applyResourceBundle` method was deprecated in Java 9 and is no longer recommended for use. The suggested alternative is to use `java.awt.Component.setLocale(Locale)` and `java.awt.Component.applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation)` methods to set the locale and component orientation of a window or component, respectively.

Here is an example of how to refactor code that uses `applyResourceBundle`:

```java
import java.awt.ComponentOrientation;
import java.awt.Frame;
import java.awt.Locale;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;

public class MyFrame extends Frame {
    
    private ResourceBundle resources;
    
    public MyFrame(ResourceBundle resources) {
        this.resources = resources;
        applyResources();
    }
    
    @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
    private void applyResources() {
        applyResourceBundle(resources);
    }
    
    // Refactored method using setLocale and applyComponentOrientation
    private void applyLocale() {
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        setLocale(locale);
        ComponentOrientation orientation = ComponentOrientation.getOrientation(locale);
        applyComponentOrientation(orientation);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the `applyResourceBundle` method is replaced by a private method `applyLocale`, which sets the locale and component orientation of the frame using the new methods `setLocale` and `applyComponentOrientation`. The `applyResources` method, which calls the deprecated `applyResourceBundle` method, is marked with the `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")` annotation to suppress deprecation warnings.

Note that this is just an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `applyResourceBundle` method. The actual refactoring required will depend on the specific context and requirements of your application.
