Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the usage of the deprecated `java.awt.Window.postEvent(Event)` method in Java:

```
// Create a new instance of Event
Event event = new Event(targetComponent, eventType, eventData);

// Post the event to the Window
window.postEvent(event);
```

To refactor this code, you can replace the usage of the `postEvent` method with the `dispatchEvent` method. Here's the updated code:

```
// Create a new instance of Event
Event event = new Event(targetComponent, eventType, eventData);

// Get the Toolkit for the default screen
Toolkit toolkit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();

// Post the event to the Toolkit's EventQueue
toolkit.getSystemEventQueue().postEvent(event);

// Dispatch the event to the Window
window.dispatchEvent(event);
```

In this refactored code, we first create a new instance of the `Event` class with the necessary arguments. Instead of directly calling the `postEvent` method on the window, we get the `Toolkit` for the default screen and then post the event to its `EventQueue`. Finally, we dispatch the event to the window using the `dispatchEvent` method.

This refactored code achieves the same result as the original code but avoids using the deprecated method `postEvent` and instead uses the recommended approach of dispatching the event to the `Toolkit`'s `EventQueue`.
