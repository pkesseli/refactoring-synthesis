Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Window.reshapeâ€‹(int, int, int, int)` method:

```java
// Before refactoring:
import java.awt.Window;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public MyWindow() {
        super(null);

        // Use of deprecated method:
        reshape(100, 100, 400, 300);
    }
}

// After refactoring:
import java.awt.Dimension;
import java.awt.Window;

public class MyWindow extends Window {
    public MyWindow() {
        super(null);

        // Use of preferred method:
        setPreferredSize(new Dimension(400, 300));
        setLocation(100, 100);
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we replace the call to `reshape` with two separate calls to `setPreferredSize` and `setLocation`. This separates the concerns of setting the size and position of the window, which can make the code more modular and easier to understand.

Note that we use `setPreferredSize` instead of `setSize`, since `setPreferredSize` is recommended for setting the preferred size of a window or component. Additionally, we use the `Dimension` class to specify the size, which is a common practice in Java for specifying dimensions.

Finally, note that we use `setLocation` instead of `setBounds`, since `setLocation` is sufficient for setting the position of the window, and is more readable than specifying the position and size in a single method call.
