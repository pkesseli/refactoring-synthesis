Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Window.show()` method.

The `show()` method was deprecated in Java 1.5 and replaced with the `setVisible()` method, which provides the same functionality but with a better naming convention. Therefore, to refactor the code that uses `show()`, we should replace it with `setVisible(true)`.

Here's an example of how to do it:

Before refactoring:

```
import java.awt.Frame;
import java.awt.Window;

public class MyWindow extends Frame {
    public MyWindow() {
        setTitle("My Window");
        setSize(400, 300);
    }

    public void showWindow() {
        show();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import java.awt.Frame;

public class MyWindow extends Frame {
    public MyWindow() {
        setTitle("My Window");
        setSize(400, 300);
    }

    public void showWindow() {
        setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

As you can see, we simply replaced the `show()` method call with `setVisible(true)` to refactor the code. By doing so, we have updated the code to use the current and recommended method for showing a window.
