Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor a piece of code that uses the deprecated `java.beans.Beans.instantiateâ€‹()` method:

```
// Before refactoring
Object obj = Beans.instantiate(classLoader, className, beanContext, initializer);

// After refactoring
Object obj = createInstance(classLoader, className);

...

private Object createInstance(ClassLoader classLoader, String className) {
    try {
        Class<?> clazz = Class.forName(className, true, classLoader);
        return clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
    } catch (ClassNotFoundException | InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException | NoSuchMethodException | InvocationTargetException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Failed to instantiate " + className, e);
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we have created a new method called `createInstance()` that uses the `Class.forName()` method to load the class and `newInstance()` to create a new instance of the class. This approach is recommended as a replacement for the deprecated `Beans.instantiate()` method.

By using this approach, we have eliminated the use of the deprecated `Beans.instantiate()` method and replaced it with a more modern and recommended approach. Additionally, this refactoring makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.
