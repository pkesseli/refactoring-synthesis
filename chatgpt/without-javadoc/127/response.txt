Sure, here's an example refactoring that avoids using the deprecated `toString(int)` method of `java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream`:

Before refactoring:
```java
ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
// ... code that writes data to the outputStream ...
String result = outputStream.toString("UTF-8");
```

After refactoring:
```java
ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
// ... code that writes data to the outputStream ...
String result = new String(outputStream.toByteArray(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

In this refactored example, we use the constructor of the `String` class that takes a byte array and a `Charset` object as arguments. This constructor creates a new string by decoding the byte array using the specified charset. 

Note that in the original code, `toString("UTF-8")` was used to convert the contents of the `ByteArrayOutputStream` to a string using the UTF-8 encoding. In the refactored code, we explicitly specify the UTF-8 charset when creating the `String` object. 

This refactoring avoids using the deprecated `toString(int)` method, and also makes the encoding explicit in the code, which can help avoid encoding-related bugs in the future.
