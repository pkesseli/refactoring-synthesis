Yes, the `toURL()` method of the `java.io.File` class has been deprecated since Java 9, and you should use `toURI().toURL()` instead. Here's an example of how to refactor your code:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.net.URL;

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("path/to/file");
        URL url = file.toURL();
        System.out.println("URL: " + url);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URI;

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        File file = new File("path/to/file");
        URI uri = file.toURI();
        URL url = uri.toURL();
        System.out.println("URL: " + url);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we first call the `toURI()` method on the `File` object to get a `URI` instance, and then call the `toURL()` method on the `URI` instance to get a `URL` instance. Note that we also added a `throws Exception` clause to the `main()` method signature to handle any potential `MalformedURLException` thrown by the `toURL()` method.
