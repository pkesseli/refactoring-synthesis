Sure, here is an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.action(Event, Object)` method:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public void processEvent(Event evt) {
        if (evt.id == Event.ACTION_EVENT) {
            // do something
            action(evt, evt.target);
        }
    }

    public void action(Event evt, Object arg) {
        // do something
    }
}
```

To refactor this code, we will replace the deprecated `action(Event, Object)` method with a new method that uses the recommended approach for handling action events in AWT/Swing components, which is to implement the `ActionListener` interface and use its `actionPerformed(ActionEvent)` method. Here's the refactored code:

```java
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyComponent extends Component implements ActionListener {
    public void processEvent(Event evt) {
        if (evt.id == Event.ACTION_EVENT) {
            // do something
            actionPerformed(new ActionEvent(evt.target, ActionEvent.ACTION_PERFORMED, null));
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        // handle action event
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we have:

1. Added an import statement for `java.awt.event.ActionEvent` and `java.awt.event.ActionListener`, which are needed for the new approach.

2. Implemented the `ActionListener` interface by adding `implements ActionListener` to the class declaration and adding the required `actionPerformed(ActionEvent)` method.

3. Replaced the call to `action(evt, evt.target)` with a call to `actionPerformed(new ActionEvent(evt.target, ActionEvent.ACTION_PERFORMED, null))`.

By making these changes, we have replaced the use of the deprecated `action(Event, Object)` method with the recommended approach for handling action events in AWT/Swing components.
