Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.io.ObjectInputStream.readLine()` method:

Before Refactoring:
```java
try {
    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream);
    String line;
    while ((line = ois.readLine()) != null) {
        // process the line
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle exception
}
```

After Refactoring:
```java
try {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        // process the line
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle exception
}
```

In the refactored code, we replace the deprecated `ObjectInputStream.readLine()` with `BufferedReader.readLine()`. We create a new `BufferedReader` instance that wraps the input stream and use its `readLine()` method to read lines of text. This is a safer and more efficient way to read text data from an input stream.
