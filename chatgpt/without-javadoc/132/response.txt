Sure! The `isJavaLetter(char)` method has been deprecated since Java 9, and its use is discouraged. Instead, you can use the `isLetter(char)` method, which checks whether a character is a letter according to the Unicode standard.

Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `isJavaLetter(char)` method:

```java
char c = 'a';
if (Character.isJavaLetter(c)) {
    // Do something with the letter
}
```

And here's the equivalent code that uses the recommended `isLetter(char)` method:

```java
char c = 'a';
if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
    // Do something with the letter
}
```

This code will have the same behavior as the original code, but it uses the recommended method instead of the deprecated one.
