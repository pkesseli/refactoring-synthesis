Sure! The `isJavaLetterOrDigit(char)` method has been deprecated since Java 9 and should be replaced with the `isLetterOrDigit(int)` method. Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `isJavaLetterOrDigit(char)`:

Before:

```java
char c = 'a';
if (Character.isJavaLetterOrDigit(c)) {
    System.out.println(c + " is a Java letter or digit");
} else {
    System.out.println(c + " is not a Java letter or digit");
}
```

After:

```java
char c = 'a';
if (Character.isLetterOrDigit((int) c)) {
    System.out.println(c + " is a letter or digit");
} else {
    System.out.println(c + " is not a letter or digit");
}
```

In the refactored code, we cast the `char` to an `int` and call the `isLetterOrDigit(int)` method instead of the deprecated `isJavaLetterOrDigit(char)` method. This change should not affect the behavior of the code, but it ensures that our code is using up-to-date methods that are not deprecated.
