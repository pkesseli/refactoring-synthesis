Sure! The `java.lang.Character.isSpace(char)` method was deprecated in Java 11 and replaced with several other methods depending on the type of whitespace being checked. Here's an example of how to refactor your code to use the appropriate replacement method:

Before refactoring:

```java
char c = ' ';
if (Character.isSpace(c)) {
    System.out.println("This is a space character.");
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
char c = ' ';
if (Character.isWhitespace(c)) {
    System.out.println("This is a whitespace character.");
}
```

In this example, we've replaced the deprecated `isSpace` method with the recommended `isWhitespace` method. Note that `isWhitespace` will return `true` for all Unicode whitespace characters, including space, tab, and newline characters. If you need to specifically check for a space character, you can use the `isSpaceChar` method instead:

```java
char c = ' ';
if (Character.isSpaceChar(c)) {
    System.out.println("This is a space character.");
}
```

This will only return `true` for the space character (Unicode value U+0020).
