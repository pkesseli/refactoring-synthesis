Sure, I'd be happy to show you an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `hasPrivateAccess()` method from the `java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup` class.

First, let's take a quick look at the documentation for the `hasPrivateAccess()` method. The documentation states that the method "Returns true if this lookup object has private access to the declaring class of the member represented by this lookup object." The method is marked as deprecated because it is considered unsafe and could be abused to bypass access controls.

To refactor code that uses this deprecated method, you should replace it with a safer alternative. One option is to use the `java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject.setAccessible(boolean flag)` method to enable access to private members. Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `hasPrivateAccess()`:

Before refactoring:

```
import java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles;

public class MyClass {
    public void doSomething(Object obj) throws Throwable {
        MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
        if (lookup.hasPrivateAccess()) {
            // do something with private member
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles;
import java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject;

public class MyClass {
    public void doSomething(Object obj) throws Throwable {
        MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
        AccessibleObject ao = (AccessibleObject) obj;
        ao.setAccessible(true);
        // do something with private member
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we first obtain a `MethodHandles.Lookup` object as before. Then, we cast the `Object` parameter to an `AccessibleObject` so that we can call the `setAccessible(boolean flag)` method on it to enable access to private members. Finally, we can perform the operation that previously required access to private members.

Keep in mind that using the `setAccessible(boolean flag)` method is still potentially unsafe and should be used with caution. It is important to ensure that your code does not abuse this capability to bypass access controls.
