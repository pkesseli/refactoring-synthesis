Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor code that uses the `finalize()` method in Java. The `finalize()` method is used for performing cleanup operations on an object before it is garbage collected. However, it has been deprecated since Java 9, and it is not recommended to use it anymore.

Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses `finalize()`:

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Some code here

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // Some cleanup operations here
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

To refactor this code, we can replace the `finalize()` method with the `try-with-resources` statement. Here's the refactored code:

```java
public class MyClass implements AutoCloseable {
    // Some code here

    @Override
    public void close() throws Exception {
        // Some cleanup operations here
    }
}
```

Now, instead of implementing the `finalize()` method, we implement the `AutoCloseable` interface and the `close()` method. The `close()` method will perform the same cleanup operations as the `finalize()` method, but it will be called explicitly when the object is no longer needed. We can use the `try-with-resources` statement to automatically call the `close()` method when the object goes out of scope.

Here's an example of how to use the refactored `MyClass`:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try (MyClass myClass = new MyClass()) {
            // Some code here
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `MyClass` inside the `try` block. When the `try` block exits, the `close()` method will be called automatically, performing the necessary cleanup operations.
