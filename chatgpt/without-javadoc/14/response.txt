Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.bounds()` method:

```
// Get the bounds of a component
Rectangle bounds = component.getBounds();

// Refactored code using the getBounds() method of the parent container
Rectangle bounds = component.getParent().getBounds(component);
```

In the above code, the `getBounds()` method of the `java.awt.Component` class is deprecated. To refactor this code, we can instead use the `getBounds(Component)` method of the parent container to get the bounds of the component. This method takes a `Component` parameter and returns the bounds of that component relative to the coordinate space of the parent container.

By using this refactored code, we can avoid using the deprecated `getBounds()` method and ensure that our code is using up-to-date and recommended API methods.
