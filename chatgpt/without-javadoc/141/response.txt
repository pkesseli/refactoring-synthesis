Sure, here is an example of how to refactor code that uses the `java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject.isAccessible()` method, which is deprecated since JDK 16:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        AccessibleObject.setAccessible(new AccessibleObject[] {myField}, true);
        boolean isAccessible = myField.isAccessible();
        // ...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Field;

public class MyClass {
    private final Field myField;

    public MyClass() throws NoSuchFieldException {
        myField = MyClass.class.getDeclaredField("myField");
        myField.setAccessible(true);
    }

    public void myMethod() throws IllegalAccessException {
        boolean isAccessible = myField.canAccess(null);
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the use of `AccessibleObject.setAccessible()` with `Field.setAccessible()` to make the field accessible. We have also used the `Field.canAccess()` method to check if the field is accessible or not.

Note that in the refactored code, we have also moved the declaration of `myField` to the class level and initialized it in the constructor of the class. This is a best practice to avoid repeatedly looking up the field using reflection, which can be expensive.
