Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.lang.Runtime.Version.major()` method.

The `java.lang.Runtime.Version.major()` method is used to obtain the major version number of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) currently running the program. The method has been deprecated in Java 17 and replaced by the `java.lang.Runtime.version()` method, which returns an instance of the `java.lang.Runtime.Version` class containing information about the current JRE version.

Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.lang.Runtime.Version.major()` method to use the new `java.lang.Runtime.version()` method:

Before:

```java
int majorVersion = Runtime.Version.major();
System.out.println("Current JRE major version: " + majorVersion);
```

After:

```java
int majorVersion = Runtime.version().major();
System.out.println("Current JRE major version: " + majorVersion);
```

In the refactored code, we are using the `java.lang.Runtime.version()` method to get an instance of the `java.lang.Runtime.Version` class, and then calling the `major()` method on that instance to obtain the major version number of the current JRE. This will work in the same way as the deprecated `java.lang.Runtime.Version.major()` method, but with the added benefit of being up-to-date and compatible with the latest versions of Java.
