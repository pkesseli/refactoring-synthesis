Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to avoid using the deprecated `java.lang.Runtime.Version.minor()` method:

Before:

```java
Runtime.Version version = Runtime.version();
int minorVersion = version.minor();
System.out.println("Minor version: " + minorVersion);
```

After:

```java
Runtime.Version version = Runtime.version();
int minorVersion = version.feature() % 100;
System.out.println("Minor version: " + minorVersion);
```

In the refactored code, we use the `feature()` method instead of `minor()`. The `feature()` method returns the major version number multiplied by 100, so we can use the modulus operator `%` to get the minor version number. This way, we avoid using the deprecated `minor()` method and ensure that our code will work correctly with future versions of Java.
