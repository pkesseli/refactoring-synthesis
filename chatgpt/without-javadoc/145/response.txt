Sure! The `java.lang.Runtime.Version.security()` method is deprecated starting from Java 17 and will be removed in a future release. It has been replaced by the `java.lang.Module.getSecurity()`, which returns the security configuration of the module.

Here's an example refactoring code snippet to replace the deprecated `java.lang.Runtime.Version.security()` method:

Before:

```java
Runtime.Version version = Runtime.Version.parse("11.0.1");
String security = version.security();
System.out.println(security);
```

After:

```java
Module module = getClass().getModule();
String security = module.getSecurity().toString();
System.out.println(security);
```

In this example, we retrieve the `Module` object associated with the current class using the `getClass().getModule()` method, and then call the `getSecurity()` method on that `Module` object to retrieve its security configuration. We then convert the returned `SecurityConfiguration` object to a `String` using its `toString()` method and print it to the console.

Note that this refactoring assumes that the code is running in a modular environment, which is required to use the `Module` API. If the code is running in a non-modular environment, the `java.lang.Runtime.Version.security()` method can still be used, but keep in mind that it is deprecated and may be removed in a future release.
