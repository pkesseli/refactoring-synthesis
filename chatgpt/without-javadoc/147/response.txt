Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `java.lang.String.getBytes(int, int, byte[], int)`:

Deprecated method signature:

```java
public void getBytes(int srcBegin, int srcEnd, byte[] dst, int dstBegin)
```

Refactored method signature:

```java
public byte[] getBytes(String charsetName) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
```

Refactored method implementation:

```java
public byte[] getBytes(String charsetName) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
    return this.getBytes(charsetName);
}
```

Explanation:

The deprecated method `getBytes(int, int, byte[], int)` is deprecated because it relies on the default platform charset, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The recommended approach is to use the `getBytes(String charsetName)` method, which allows you to specify the character encoding explicitly.

The refactored method signature takes a single argument `charsetName` which specifies the character encoding to use. The method implementation simply calls the original `getBytes` method with the specified character encoding.

Note that `getBytes` method can still throw a `UnsupportedEncodingException` if the specified character encoding is not supported by the platform. It's important to handle this exception appropriately, either by re-throwing it or by handling it within the method.
