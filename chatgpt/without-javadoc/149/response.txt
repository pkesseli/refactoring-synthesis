Yes, the `java.lang.Thread.resume()` method has been deprecated since Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.2. It is not recommended to use this method in modern Java programming because it can cause the thread to behave in an unpredictable manner.

Instead of using the `Thread.resume()` method, you can use the `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock` interface to manage thread synchronization. The `Lock` interface provides a more flexible and robust mechanism for managing threads than the traditional `synchronized` keyword and the `wait()` and `notify()` methods.

Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `Thread.resume()` to use `Lock`:

```
// Original code using Thread.resume()
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.start();
thread.resume(); // Deprecated method

// Refactored code using Lock
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
Condition condition = lock.newCondition();

Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    lock.lock();
    try {
        condition.await(); // Thread waits until signaled
        // Thread code here
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Exception handling
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
});

thread.start();
lock.lock();
try {
    condition.signal(); // Signal thread to continue
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

In this refactored code, we create a `Lock` object and a `Condition` object that is associated with the lock. We then create a new thread and define its behavior using a lambda expression. The thread acquires the lock, waits for a signal using the `await()` method, and then executes the thread code.

In the main thread, we start the new thread and signal it to continue using the `signal()` method on the `Condition` object. This ensures that the new thread will start executing at the correct time and in a synchronized manner.

By using the `Lock` and `Condition` objects, we have a more flexible and reliable way to manage thread synchronization than using the deprecated `Thread.resume()` method.
