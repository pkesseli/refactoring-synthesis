Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.lang.Thread.suspend()` method:

Before Refactoring:

```
Thread myThread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());

myThread.start();

myThread.suspend();
```

After Refactoring:

```
Thread myThread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());

myThread.start();

// use a flag variable to control the execution of the thread
boolean suspendFlag = true;

while (suspendFlag) {
    // do nothing or sleep the thread
}

// when the thread is ready to resume execution, set the flag to false
suspendFlag = false;
```

In this refactored code, instead of using the `suspend()` method to pause the execution of the thread, we use a flag variable to control the flow of execution. The `while` loop keeps the thread in a suspended state until the `suspendFlag` variable is set to false. To resume execution, we simply set the `suspendFlag` variable to false.

This approach is safer and more reliable than using the `suspend()` method, which can cause deadlocks and other issues if not used properly. Additionally, this refactored code is compatible with Java versions that do not support the `suspend()` method or have deprecated it.
