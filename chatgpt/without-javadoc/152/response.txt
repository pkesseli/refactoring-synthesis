Sure! 

The `java.lang.ThreadGroup.allowThreadSuspension(boolean)` method was deprecated in Java 9 and replaced by the `java.lang.ThreadGroup.setDaemon(boolean)` method. 

Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method:

```
// Old code using deprecated method
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
group.allowThreadSuspension(true);

// Refactored code using new method
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
group.setDaemon(true);
```

In this example, we simply replaced the call to the deprecated method with the new method. The `setDaemon(boolean)` method sets the thread group's daemon status, which determines whether its threads should terminate when the program exits.

Note that if you need to check whether a thread group allows thread suspension, you can use the `ThreadGroup.isDaemon()` method instead of the deprecated `allowThreadSuspension()` method:

```
// Old code using deprecated method
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
boolean allowSuspend = group.allowThreadSuspension();

// Refactored code using new method
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("myThreadGroup");
boolean allowSuspend = !group.isDaemon();
```

In this case, we check whether the thread group is a daemon (the opposite of the old method's behavior) and invert the result to get the correct value for whether thread suspension is allowed.
