The `java.lang.ThreadGroup.resume()` method has been deprecated since JDK 1.2, and the recommended alternative is to use the `java.lang.Thread` class's `resume()` method. However, the `resume()` method is also deprecated since JDK 11 and is strongly discouraged due to its potential to cause thread deadlock and other synchronization problems. 

Therefore, instead of using the deprecated `resume()` method, you should consider refactoring your code to use a different approach to thread management, such as the `java.util.concurrent` package or other higher-level concurrency abstractions.

If you absolutely must use the deprecated `resume()` method, here is an example of how you can refactor your code to avoid using it:

```java
// Before refactoring
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("exampleThreadGroup");
Thread thread = new Thread(threadGroup, new ExampleRunnable());
thread.start();
threadGroup.resume();

// After refactoring
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.submit(new ExampleRunnable());
```

In this example, instead of creating a `ThreadGroup` and starting a `Thread` within it, and then calling `resume()` on the `ThreadGroup`, we use the `ExecutorService` interface provided by the `java.util.concurrent` package to manage our threads.

We create a `newSingleThreadExecutor()` instance, which creates a single worker thread to execute our `Runnable` task. We then submit the `ExampleRunnable` task to the executor using the `submit()` method.

This approach is simpler and more flexible than the deprecated `ThreadGroup.resume()` method, as it allows us to use a higher-level concurrency abstraction and easily manage our threads.
