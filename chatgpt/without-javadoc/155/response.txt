Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.lang.ThreadGroup.suspend()` method:

Before:

```java
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("exampleThreadGroup");

// Add some threads to the thread group
Thread thread1 = new Thread(threadGroup, new MyRunnable());
Thread thread2 = new Thread(threadGroup, new MyRunnable());
thread1.start();
thread2.start();

// Suspend all threads in the thread group
threadGroup.suspend();
```

After:

```java
ThreadGroup threadGroup = new ThreadGroup("exampleThreadGroup");

// Add some threads to the thread group
Thread thread1 = new Thread(threadGroup, new MyRunnable());
Thread thread2 = new Thread(threadGroup, new MyRunnable());
thread1.start();
thread2.start();

// Iterate over all threads in the thread group and suspend them one by one
Thread[] threads = new Thread[threadGroup.activeCount()];
threadGroup.enumerate(threads);
for (Thread thread : threads) {
    thread.suspend();
}
```

In the refactored code, we no longer use the `ThreadGroup.suspend()` method, which has been deprecated since Java 1.2. Instead, we iterate over all the threads in the thread group using the `ThreadGroup.enumerate()` method, and suspend each thread individually using the `Thread.suspend()` method.

Note that the use of `Thread.suspend()` is also discouraged as it can lead to potential deadlocks and other issues, and it's generally better to use more modern concurrency mechanisms such as the `java.util.concurrent` package.
