Sure, I can provide an example of refactoring the deprecated `java.lang.ThreadGroup.suspend()` method. 

The `suspend()` method is used to pause all the threads in a thread group. However, it has been deprecated since Java 1.2 because it can cause deadlocks and other issues. 

To refactor this method, you can use the `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock` class to implement a lock that can be used to pause and resume threads in a more controlled manner.

Here is an example of how you can refactor the `ThreadGroup.suspend()` method using a `ReentrantLock`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class MyThreadGroup extends ThreadGroup {
    private ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void pauseThreads() {
        lock.lock();
    }

    public void resumeThreads() {
        lock.unlock();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `pauseThreads()` method acquires the lock, which will cause all threads that try to acquire the same lock to block until the lock is released by the `resumeThreads()` method.

You can use this `MyThreadGroup` class in your code instead of the deprecated `ThreadGroup` class, and call the `pauseThreads()` and `resumeThreads()` methods to pause and resume threads in a more controlled manner.

Here's an example of how you can use the `MyThreadGroup` class to pause and resume threads:

```java
MyThreadGroup threadGroup = new MyThreadGroup("MyThreadGroup");
Thread thread1 = new Thread(threadGroup, new MyRunnable());
Thread thread2 = new Thread(threadGroup, new MyRunnable());

thread1.start();
thread2.start();

// Pause threads
threadGroup.pauseThreads();

// Resume threads
threadGroup.resumeThreads();
```

In this example, the `thread1` and `thread2` threads are part of the `MyThreadGroup` thread group, which has the `pauseThreads()` and `resumeThreads()` methods that can be used to pause and resume the threads.
