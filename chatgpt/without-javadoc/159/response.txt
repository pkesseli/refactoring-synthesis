Sure! The `getTTL()` method in `java.net.DatagramSocketImpl` has been deprecated since JDK 1.1, and the recommended alternative is to use the `getTTL()` method in `java.net.MulticastSocket`. Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the recommended method:

Before refactoring:

```
import java.net.DatagramSocketImpl;

public class MyDatagramSocketImpl extends DatagramSocketImpl {
    public int getTTL() {
        return super.getTTL();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import java.net.MulticastSocket;

public class MyMulticastSocket extends MulticastSocket {
    public int getTTL() throws IOException {
        return super.getTimeToLive();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new class `MyMulticastSocket` that extends `java.net.MulticastSocket` and overrides the `getTTL()` method. We use the `getTimeToLive()` method in the superclass to get the TTL value instead of the deprecated `getTTL()` method in the `DatagramSocketImpl` class.

Note that we also need to handle the `IOException` that the `getTimeToLive()` method can throw. Depending on how your code is structured, you may need to modify any code that calls the `getTTL()` method to handle this exception as well.
