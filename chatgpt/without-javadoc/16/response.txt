Sure! The `java.awt.Component.disable()` method is deprecated because it has been replaced by a newer method called `java.awt.Component.setEnabled(boolean)`. The `setEnabled(boolean)` method provides the same functionality as `disable()`, but it also allows the component to be re-enabled later, which can be useful in certain situations.

Here's an example of how you might refactor some code that uses `disable()` to use `setEnabled(false)` instead:

Before refactoring:
```
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.disable();
```

After refactoring:
```
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
myButton.setEnabled(false);
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace `disable()` with `setEnabled(false)`. This ensures that the button is disabled, but also allows it to be re-enabled later if needed.

It's worth noting that if you have a large codebase with many instances of `disable()`, it may be more efficient to use a search-and-replace tool to update all instances at once, rather than manually updating each one.
