Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `disable()` method:

```
// Before refactoring:
Button button = new Button("Click Me");
button.disable();

```

To refactor this code, you can replace the `disable()` method with the recommended alternative, which is `setEnabled(false)`. Here's the refactored code:

```
// After refactoring:
Button button = new Button("Click Me");
button.setEnabled(false);
```

By using `setEnabled(false)`, you achieve the same result as using `disable()`, but without relying on a deprecated method. This makes your code more future-proof, as you won't have to worry about the `disable()` method being removed or changed in a future version of Java.
