Sure! The `java.net.DatagramSocketImpl.setTTL(byte)` method has been deprecated since Java 9, and the recommended alternative is to use the `java.net.MulticastSocket.setTimeToLive(int)` method instead. Here's an example of how you can refactor your code:

Before:
```java
DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket();
socket.setTTL((byte) 64);
```

After:
```java
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
socket.setTimeToLive(64);
```

In this example, we've replaced the `DatagramSocket` with a `MulticastSocket`, and used the `setTimeToLive(int)` method instead of the deprecated `setTTL(byte)` method. Note that the `setTimeToLive(int)` method takes an `int` parameter instead of a `byte` parameter, so we've also changed the value passed to the method from `(byte) 64` to `64`.

Remember to update any other relevant parts of your code that use the deprecated `setTTL(byte)` method to use the recommended alternative.
