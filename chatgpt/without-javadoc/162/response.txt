Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `getLoopbackMode()` method from `MulticastSocket`:

```java
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
boolean loopback = socket.getLoopbackMode();
if (loopback) {
    // Do something
}
```

To refactor this code, we need to replace the deprecated method with a non-deprecated alternative. The Java documentation suggests using the `NetworkInterface` class to set or get the loopback mode of a `MulticastSocket` instead.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(socket.getInetAddress());
boolean loopback = networkInterface.getInterfaceAddresses().stream()
                          .anyMatch(address -> address.getAddress().isLoopbackAddress());
if (loopback) {
    // Do something
}
```

In this refactored code, we first get the `NetworkInterface` associated with the `MulticastSocket` by calling `NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(socket.getInetAddress())`. We then check if any of the `InterfaceAddress` objects associated with the `NetworkInterface` has a loopback address by using the `anyMatch()` method of a Java 8 `Stream`.

Note that this refactored code assumes that the `MulticastSocket` has already been bound to a multicast address using the `joinGroup()` method. If the `MulticastSocket` has not been bound yet, you will need to call `socket.joinGroup()` first.
