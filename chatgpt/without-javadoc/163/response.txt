Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.net.MulticastSocket.getTTL()` method to use a non-deprecated alternative:

```java
// Old code using deprecated method
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
int ttl = socket.getTTL();

// Refactored code using non-deprecated method
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
socket.setTimeToLive(2);
int ttl = socket.getTimeToLive();
```

In the refactored code, we use the `setTimeToLive(int ttl)` method instead of `getTTL()` to set the time to live for the multicast packets. Then, we use the non-deprecated `getTimeToLive()` method to retrieve the time to live value. This ensures that the code continues to work as expected while avoiding the use of deprecated methods.
