Certainly! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.net.MulticastSocket.leaveGroup​(InetAddress)` method:

Before Refactoring:
```java
InetAddress groupAddress = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(1234);
socket.joinGroup(groupAddress);
// ...
socket.leaveGroup(groupAddress);
```

After Refactoring:
```java
InetAddress groupAddress = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
try (MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket()) {
    socket.joinGroup(new InetSocketAddress(groupAddress, 1234), NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(groupAddress));
    // ...
    socket.leaveGroup(new InetSocketAddress(groupAddress, 1234), NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(groupAddress));
}
```

In the refactored code, we use the `java.net.MulticastSocket.joinGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface)` method to join the multicast group with the specified `InetAddress` and port number, and also specify the `NetworkInterface` to use. We then use the `java.net.MulticastSocket.leaveGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface)` method to leave the multicast group with the same `InetAddress` and port number, and `NetworkInterface`. We also use the try-with-resources statement to automatically close the `MulticastSocket`.

Note that the `java.net.MulticastSocket.joinGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface)` method was introduced in Java 9 as a replacement for the deprecated `java.net.MulticastSocket.joinGroup​(InetAddress)` and `java.net.MulticastSocket.joinGroup​(SocketAddress)` methods. Similarly, the `java.net.MulticastSocket.leaveGroup(SocketAddress, NetworkInterface)` method was introduced as a replacement for the deprecated `java.net.MulticastSocket.leaveGroup​(InetAddress)` method.
