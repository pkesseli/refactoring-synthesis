Certainly! The `setInterface` method of `MulticastSocket` has been deprecated since JDK 9. The new recommended way to specify the network interface for a `MulticastSocket` is to use the `setNetworkInterface` method. Here is an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated method:

Before:
```
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(12345);
socket.setInterface(InetAddress.getLocalHost());
socket.joinGroup(group);
```

After:
```
InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(12345);
NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(InetAddress.getLocalHost());
socket.setNetworkInterface(networkInterface);
socket.joinGroup(group);
```

As you can see, the `setInterface` method call has been replaced with a call to `setNetworkInterface`, which takes a `NetworkInterface` object as an argument. The `NetworkInterface` instance is obtained using the `getByInetAddress` method, which takes an `InetAddress` representing the local host. Finally, the `joinGroup` method call remains the same.
