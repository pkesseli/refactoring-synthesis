Certainly! The `setTTL(byte)` method in `java.net.MulticastSocket` has been deprecated since Java 9, and you should use the `setTimeToLive(int)` method instead. Here's an example of how to refactor your code to use the non-deprecated method:

```java
// Create a multicast socket
MulticastSocket multicastSocket = new MulticastSocket(port);

// Set the time-to-live for multicast packets to 5 (deprecated)
multicastSocket.setTTL((byte) 5);

// Refactored code using setTimeToLive() instead
multicastSocket.setTimeToLive(5);
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the call to `setTTL(byte)` with `setTimeToLive(int)`, passing the same value as an `int`. This will ensure that your code is using the current method and is not affected by the deprecation of the older method.
