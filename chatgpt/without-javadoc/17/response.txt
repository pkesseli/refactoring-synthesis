Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.enable()` method. 

First, let's understand why this method is deprecated. According to the Java documentation, the `enable()` method has been deprecated because it does not correctly handle lightweight components, which were introduced in Java 1.1. Instead, it is recommended to use the `setEnabled(boolean)` method, which handles both heavyweight and lightweight components correctly.

Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses `enable()`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Button;

public class Example {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Button myButton = new Button("Click me");
      myButton.enable();
   }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Button;

public class Example {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Button myButton = new Button("Click me");
      myButton.setEnabled(true);
   }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `enable()` method with the recommended `setEnabled(boolean)` method. We also pass a boolean value of `true` to the `setEnabled()` method to enable the button.

Note that in most cases, it is better to use a layout manager to manage the placement and sizing of components rather than setting their size and location manually. This can help your UI look consistent across different platforms and devices.
