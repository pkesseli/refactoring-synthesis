Sure, I can show you an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.dgc.VMID.isUnique()` method. 

First, let's understand why the `isUnique()` method is deprecated. According to the Java documentation, the `isUnique()` method is deprecated because it always returns true, and therefore does not provide any useful information. 

To refactor code that uses `isUnique()`, we need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality. One option is to use the `java.util.UUID` class, which provides a way to generate unique identifiers. Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses `isUnique()` to use `UUID` instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.dgc.VMID;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VMID id = new VMID();
        if (id.isUnique()) {
            System.out.println("ID is unique");
        } else {
            System.out.println("ID is not unique");
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.util.UUID;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UUID id = UUID.randomUUID();
        System.out.println("ID: " + id.toString());
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we no longer need to use the `isUnique()` method because `UUID.randomUUID()` generates a unique identifier every time it is called. The refactored code simply prints out the generated `UUID`. 

Note that the `UUID` class provides several other methods that can be used to manipulate and format UUIDs as needed.
