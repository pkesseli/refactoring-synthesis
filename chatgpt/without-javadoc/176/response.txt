Sure, I'd be happy to provide a refactoring example for the deprecated `java.rmi.registry.RegistryHandler.registryImpl(int)` method.

The `registryImpl(int)` method was used to obtain the implementation of the RMI registry for a given port number. However, it has been deprecated since JDK 1.2 and should no longer be used. Instead, the recommended way to obtain a registry is to use the `java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry.getRegistry(int)` method.

Here's an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated method:

```
// Before refactoring
RegistryHandler registryHandler = new RegistryHandler();
Registry registry = registryHandler.registryImpl(1099);

// After refactoring
Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(1099);
```

In the refactored code, we are using the `getRegistry(int)` method of `LocateRegistry` instead of the deprecated `registryImpl(int)` method of `RegistryHandler`.

Note that if your code has additional dependencies or requirements beyond simply obtaining a registry, you may need to modify your code further to accommodate those requirements.
