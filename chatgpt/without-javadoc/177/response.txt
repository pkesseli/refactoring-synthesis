Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.rmi.registry.RegistryHandler.registryStub(String, int)` method:

Deprecated method signature:
```java
public static Remote registryStub(String host, int port) throws RemoteException
```

Refactored method signature:
```java
public static Remote getRegistryStub(String host, int port) throws RemoteException, NotBoundException, MalformedURLException
```

Refactored method implementation:
```java
public static Remote getRegistryStub(String host, int port) throws RemoteException, NotBoundException, MalformedURLException {
    Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(host, port);
    return registry.lookup("SomeRemoteObject"); // replace with the name of the remote object you are looking up
}
```

Explanation:
The `registryStub` method was deprecated because it relied on the `RegistryHandler` class, which is no longer used in newer versions of Java. To refactor this method, we can use the `LocateRegistry` class to get a reference to the remote registry and then use the `lookup` method to get a stub for a specific remote object.

In the refactored method, we first use `LocateRegistry.getRegistry` to get a reference to the remote registry running on the specified host and port. Then we use the `lookup` method on the registry object to retrieve the stub for the remote object we want to access.

Note that in the refactored method signature, we have also added two new exceptions that may be thrown: `NotBoundException` and `MalformedURLException`. These exceptions may be thrown if the remote object is not bound in the registry or if the specified URL is malformed, respectively.

You can replace `"SomeRemoteObject"` with the name of the remote object you are trying to access.
