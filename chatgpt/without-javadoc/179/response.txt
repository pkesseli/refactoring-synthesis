Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LoaderHandler.loadClassâ€‹(String)` method in Java.

The `loadClass(String)` method of `java.rmi.server.LoaderHandler` was used to load classes on the remote JVM, but has been deprecated since Java 9. Instead, it is recommended to use the standard class loading mechanisms provided by the JVM.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the code to use the standard class loading mechanism:

Before:

```
String className = "com.example.MyClass";
Class<?> myClass = LoaderHandler.loadClass(className);
```

After:

```
String className = "com.example.MyClass";
Class<?> myClass = Class.forName(className);
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `LoaderHandler.loadClass` method with the `Class.forName` method which is the standard way to load classes in Java. This method is available in the `java.lang` package, so you don't need to import anything new.

Note that `Class.forName` throws a `ClassNotFoundException` if the specified class is not found, so you'll need to handle that exception accordingly in your code.

I hope this helps!
