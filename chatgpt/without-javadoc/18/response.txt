Sure! The `enable(boolean)` method in `java.awt.Component` has been deprecated since Java 9, and the Java documentation recommends using the `setEnabled(boolean)` method instead. 

Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the `setEnabled(boolean)` method instead of `enable(boolean)`:

Before:
```java
Button myButton = new Button("Click me");
myButton.enable(false);
```

After:
```java
Button myButton = new Button("Click me");
myButton.setEnabled(false);
```

In this example, we simply replace the deprecated `enable(false)` method with the recommended `setEnabled(false)` method. This is a straightforward refactoring that should be easy to implement in your code. 

Note that the `setEnabled(boolean)` method is inherited from `java.awt.Component` and is not specific to the `Button` class. So if you're using `enable(boolean)` on other types of components in your code, you can replace those calls with `setEnabled(boolean)` in the same way.
