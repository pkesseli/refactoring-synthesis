Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.LogStream.getDefaultStream()`:

Original code using deprecated method:

```java
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyClass {
   public void myMethod() {
      LogStream log = LogStream.getDefaultStream();
      log.println("Hello World!");
   }
}
```

Refactored code using recommended method:

```java
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import java.util.logging.Level;

public class MyClass {
   private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());

   public void myMethod() {
      LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Hello World!");
   }
}
```

In this refactored code, we replaced the deprecated method `LogStream.getDefaultStream()` with the `java.util.logging.Logger` class, which is the recommended way to perform logging in Java. 

We create a static `LOGGER` instance with the name of the class and use its `log()` method to print the log message at the desired level, which in this case is `Level.INFO`. 

Note that the `java.util.logging` package provides a lot more functionality for logging and managing logs than the deprecated `LogStream` class. Therefore, this refactored code will be more maintainable and extendable than the original code.
