Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream.log(String)` method:

Before refactoring:

```
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyServer {

    private LogStream logStream;

    public MyServer() {
        logStream = LogStream.log("myServerLog");
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        logStream.println("Doing something...");
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyServer {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyServer.class.getName());

    public MyServer() {
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        LOGGER.info("Doing something...");
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `LogStream` class with the standard `java.util.logging.Logger` class. We've also changed the logging level to `INFO` instead of `println`, which is a better practice.

Note that in the original code, we were creating an instance of `LogStream` in the constructor and using it throughout the class. In the refactored code, we're using a static `LOGGER` object, which is initialized once and can be used throughout the class.

Hope that helps!
