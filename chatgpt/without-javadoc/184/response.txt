Sure, I can provide an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream.parseLevel(String)` method. 

Before we start, it's worth noting that when a method is deprecated, it means that it's still usable, but there's a better or more up-to-date way to achieve the same result. In this case, the `parseLevel` method has been deprecated since Java 9 and should be replaced with `java.util.logging.Level.parse(String)`.

Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `java.rmi.server.LogStream.parseLevel(String)`:

```java
// Deprecated code using java.rmi.server.LogStream.parseLevel(String)
String logLevelStr = "INFO";
int logLevelInt = java.rmi.server.LogStream.parseLevel(logLevelStr);

// Refactored code using java.util.logging.Level.parse(String)
String logLevelStr = "INFO";
Level logLevel = Level.parse(logLevelStr);
```

As you can see, the code using `java.rmi.server.LogStream.parseLevel(String)` is replaced with `java.util.logging.Level.parse(String)`. The `Level.parse(String)` method returns a `Level` object, which is more convenient to work with than the integer returned by the `parseLevel` method.

By refactoring your code to use the new method, you can ensure that your code will continue to work as expected and will be compatible with future Java versions.
