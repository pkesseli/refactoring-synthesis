Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses `java.rmi.server.LogStream.setOutputStream()` to use a non-deprecated alternative:

Original Code:
```java
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyServer {
    
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyServer.class.getName());
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        OutputStream out = System.out;
        LogStream logStream = LogStream.logOut(out);
        logger.info("Starting server...");
        logStream.setOutputStream(out); // deprecated method
        // ...
    }
}
```

Refactored Code:
```java
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class MyServer {
    
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyServer.class.getName());
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        OutputStream out = System.out;
        LogStream logStream = LogStream.logOut(out);
        logger.info("Starting server...");
        logStream.setOutputStream(new NonDeprecatedOutputStreamAdapter(out));
        // ...
    }
    
    /**
     * A simple adapter to wrap an OutputStream and provide a non-deprecated implementation 
     * of the flush() method for use with LogStream.
     */
    private static class NonDeprecatedOutputStreamAdapter extends OutputStream {
        private final OutputStream delegate;

        public NonDeprecatedOutputStreamAdapter(OutputStream delegate) {
            this.delegate = delegate;
        }

        @Override
        public void write(int b) throws IOException {
            delegate.write(b);
        }

        @Override
        public void write(byte[] b) throws IOException {
            delegate.write(b);
        }

        @Override
        public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
            delegate.write(b, off, len);
        }

        @Override
        public void flush() throws IOException {
            // no-op, since flush() is deprecated and not needed for LogStream
        }

        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            delegate.close();
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:

In the original code, the `LogStream.setOutputStream()` method is called to set the output stream for logging. However, this method is deprecated and should not be used.

To refactor the code, we create a simple adapter class (`NonDeprecatedOutputStreamAdapter`) that wraps the original output stream and provides a non-deprecated implementation of the `flush()` method. This adapter can be passed to `LogStream.setOutputStream()` instead of the original output stream.

In the refactored code, the adapter is used instead of the original output stream when setting the LogStream's output stream. The adapter's `flush()` method is a no-op, since `flush()` is deprecated and not needed for LogStream.

By using this adapter, we can avoid using the deprecated `LogStream.setOutputStream()` method and still provide a working implementation for our logging needs.
