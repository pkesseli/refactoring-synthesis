Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The `java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(byte[], int, int)` method is deprecated, which means that it is no longer recommended to use it in your Java code. Instead, you should use an alternative method to achieve the same result. One way to refactor your code is to use the `java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(int)` method instead. Here's an example:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyServer {
    private LogStream log;

    public void writeToLog(byte[] data, int offset, int length) {
        log.write(data, offset, length);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.LogStream;

public class MyServer {
    private LogStream log;

    public void writeToLog(byte[] data, int offset, int length) {
        for (int i = offset; i < offset + length; i++) {
            log.write(data[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we're using a `for` loop to iterate over the bytes in the `data` array and call the `log.write(int)` method for each byte. This achieves the same result as the deprecated `log.write(byte[], int, int)` method, but with the recommended alternative `log.write(int)` method.

Note that this is just one example of how you could refactor your code to use the recommended alternative method. Depending on the context of your code and what you're trying to achieve, there may be other ways to refactor your code as well.
