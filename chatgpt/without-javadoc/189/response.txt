Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(int)` method.

First, let's understand what the method does. According to the Java documentation, this method "writes the specified byte to the log stream". It takes an integer argument that represents a byte to be written to the log.

To refactor this code, we need to find an alternative method that achieves the same result. In this case, we can use the `java.util.logging.Logger` class to write log messages instead.

Here is an example of how to use the `Logger` class to write a log message:

```java
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Example {
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Example.class.getName());
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        logger.info("This is a log message");
    }
}
```

In this example, we first import the `Logger` class. We then create a `Logger` instance called `logger` using the `getLogger` method, passing in the name of the class as an argument. Finally, we use the `info` method of the `Logger` class to write a log message.

Note that the `Logger` class provides several methods for writing log messages, including `fine`, `info`, `warning`, `severe`, and others. You can choose the appropriate method depending on the severity of the message.

To refactor code that uses the `java.rmi.server.LogStream.write(int)` method, you can simply replace the method call with a call to the appropriate method of the `Logger` class. For example, if you were previously calling `log.write(97)`, you can replace that line with `logger.info("a")`.
