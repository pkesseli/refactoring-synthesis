Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor the `java.awt.Component.gotFocus(Event, Object)` method, which is deprecated, to use the `java.awt.event.FocusListener` interface instead:

Before refactoring:

```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    
    public void gotFocus(Event evt, Object arg) {
        // implementation code here
    }
    
    // other code here
}
```

After refactoring:

```
public class MyComponent extends Component implements FocusListener {
    
    public void focusGained(FocusEvent evt) {
        // implementation code here
    }
    
    public void focusLost(FocusEvent evt) {
        // implementation code here
    }
    
    // other code here
}
```

In the refactored code, we've added the `implements FocusListener` clause to the class declaration to indicate that `MyComponent` will be using the `FocusListener` interface. We then added the two required methods for `FocusListener`: `focusGained` and `focusLost`, which will be called whenever the component gains or loses focus. We then moved the implementation code from `gotFocus` to `focusGained`, and added an implementation for `focusLost` if needed.

Finally, you'll want to make sure you remove any calls to `gotFocus` and replace them with calls to `addFocusListener` to register your `FocusListener`. Here's an example of how you can add a `FocusListener` to a component:

```
MyComponent myComponent = new MyComponent();
myComponent.addFocusListener(new FocusListener() {
    public void focusGained(FocusEvent evt) {
        // implementation code here
    }
    
    public void focusLost(FocusEvent evt) {
        // implementation code here
    }
});
``` 

That should give you a good starting point for refactoring the `gotFocus` method to use the `FocusListener` interface instead.
