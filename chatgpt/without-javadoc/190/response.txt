Sure! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.Operation.getOperation()` method:

```java
Operation operation = Operation.getOperation(method);
```

Instead of using the deprecated method, we can refactor the code to use the recommended alternative, which is to use `java.rmi.server.RemoteRef`:

```java
RemoteRef remoteRef = ((RemoteObject) obj).getRef();
Operation operation = remoteRef.newCall((RemoteObject) obj, method, parameterTypes, 1);
```

Here, we first obtain a `RemoteRef` object using the `getRef()` method on the `RemoteObject` instance `obj`. We then create a new `Operation` object using the `newCall()` method on the `RemoteRef` instance. The `newCall()` method takes in the `RemoteObject` instance, the method to be called, the parameter types for the method, and a call ID as arguments.

Note that this refactored code may require additional changes depending on the context in which it is used.
