Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.Operation.toString()` method.

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.Operation;

public class Example {
    public void someMethod(Operation operation) {
        String operationString = operation.toString();
        System.out.println("Operation: " + operationString);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.Operation;

public class Example {
    public void someMethod(Operation operation) {
        String operationName = operation.getClass().getName();
        System.out.println("Operation: " + operationName);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we're using the `getClass()` method to get the `Class` object of the `Operation` instance. Then, we're using the `getName()` method of the `Class` object to get the name of the operation class, which is equivalent to the string representation of the operation. This achieves the same functionality as the deprecated `toString()` method, without using it directly.
