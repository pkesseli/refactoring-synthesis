Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor the `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.done()` method that is deprecated:

Deprecated method signature:

```java
public void done() throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
```

Refactored method signature:

```java
public void close() throws java.io.IOException;
```

Refactored method implementation:

```java
public void close() throws java.io.IOException {
    // close any resources used by the RemoteCall implementation
    // for example, you might close a socket or input/output streams
    // that were used to send and receive data over the network
}
```

Explanation:

The `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.done()` method is deprecated, which means that it is no longer recommended to use it. Instead, you can refactor the method by creating a new method with a different name and signature that performs the same or similar functionality as the deprecated method.

In this example, we can create a new method called `close()` that performs the same function as the deprecated `done()` method. The `close()` method will close any resources used by the RemoteCall implementation, such as sockets or input/output streams that were used to send and receive data over the network.

Note that we have changed the exception thrown by the method from `java.rmi.RemoteException` to `java.io.IOException`. This is because the `close()`
