Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `executeCall()` method in Java's `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall` interface:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;

public class ExampleClass {
    public void doSomething(RemoteCall call) {
        call.executeCall();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;

public class ExampleClass {
    public void doSomething(RemoteCall call) {
        call.run();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `executeCall()` method is replaced with the `run()` method, which is not deprecated and has the same functionality. This ensures that the code continues to work as expected while also avoiding the use of deprecated methods.

However, keep in mind that simply changing a deprecated method to a non-deprecated method may not be sufficient in all cases, as there may be additional changes needed to ensure that the code continues to work properly with the new method. Therefore, it's important to thoroughly test any refactored code to ensure that it still works as intended.
