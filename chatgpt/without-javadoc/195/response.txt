Sure! Here's an example refactoring that demonstrates how to replace the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.getOutputStream()` with a recommended alternative:

Before refactoring:

```java
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
OutputStream outputStream = remoteCall.getOutputStream();
// Use outputStream to write data to the remote object
```

After refactoring:

```java
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...;
ByteArrayOutputStream byteStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
OutputStream outputStream = new BufferedOutputStream(byteStream);
// Use outputStream to write data to the remote object
byte[] requestData = byteStream.toByteArray();
```

In this refactored code, we first create a `ByteArrayOutputStream`, which is an implementation of `OutputStream` that writes data to a byte array. We then wrap this stream in a `BufferedOutputStream`, which provides buffering functionality for improved performance. Finally, we use the `OutputStream` to write data to the remote object.

To read the data on the remote end, we can retrieve the byte array containing the data by calling `byteStream.toByteArray()` and pass it to the remote object. On the remote end, we can then create a `ByteArrayInputStream` from the byte array and read the data from it using an `ObjectInputStream` or similar mechanism.

By using this refactored code, we avoid using the deprecated `getOutputStream()` method and instead use a recommended alternative that achieves the same result.
