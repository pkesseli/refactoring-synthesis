Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.getResultStream(boolean)` method:

```
// Deprecated method call
InputStream resultStream = remoteCall.getResultStream(true);

// Refactored code using alternative method
Object result = remoteCall.getResult();
if (result instanceof InputStream) {
    resultStream = (InputStream) result;
}
```

In this example, we first call the deprecated method `getResultStream(true)` to obtain an `InputStream` representing the result of a remote method call. We then refactor the code to use an alternative method `getResult()` that returns an `Object` representing the result. We then check if the result is an `InputStream` using the `instanceof` operator and cast it to an `InputStream` if necessary.

This refactored code should work just as well as the original code, but it avoids using a deprecated method and should be more future-proof.
