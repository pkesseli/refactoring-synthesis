Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.getResultStream(boolean)` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...; // obtain a RemoteCall instance
boolean useCompression = true;
InputStream inputStream = remoteCall.getResultStream(useCompression);
```

After refactoring:

```java
RemoteCall remoteCall = ...; // obtain a RemoteCall instance
boolean useCompression = true;
Object result = remoteCall.getResult();
if (result instanceof InputStream) {
    InputStream inputStream = (InputStream) result;
    // use the input stream as before
} else {
    // handle the case where the result is not an InputStream
}
```

In the refactored code, we first call the `getResult()` method instead of `getResultStream()`. This method returns an `Object` instead of an `InputStream`. We then check if the result is an `InputStream` using the `instanceof` operator, and if so, we cast it to an `InputStream` and use it as before. If the result is not an `InputStream`, we can handle the result according to the requirements of the application.
