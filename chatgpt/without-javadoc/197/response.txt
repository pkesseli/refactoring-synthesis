Sure, here is an example refactoring that demonstrates how to update code that uses the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.releaseInputStream()`:

Before Refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteServer;

public class ExampleClass {

  public void exampleMethod(RemoteCall remoteCall) {
    // Do some work with the input stream...
    remoteCall.releaseInputStream();
  }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;
import java.rmi.server.RemoteServer;

public class ExampleClass {

  public void exampleMethod(RemoteCall remoteCall) {
    // Do some work with the input stream...
    RemoteServer.getClientHost(); // Use a non-deprecated method instead
  }
}
```

In this example, the deprecated `remoteCall.releaseInputStream()` method has been replaced with a call to `RemoteServer.getClientHost()`, which retrieves the hostname of the client that initiated the remote method call. This new code accomplishes a similar task as the old code, but without using a deprecated method.

Note that the specific replacement method used in this refactoring will depend on the specific use case of the original code. In some cases, it may be appropriate to use a different method or approach to achieve the same functionality.
