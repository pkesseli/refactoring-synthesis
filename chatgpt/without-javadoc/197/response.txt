Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated method `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.releaseInputStream()`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;

public class ExampleClass {
    
    public void exampleMethod(RemoteCall remoteCall) {
        // Some code here...
        remoteCall.releaseInputStream();
        // More code here...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteCall;

public class ExampleClass {
    
    public void exampleMethod(RemoteCall remoteCall) {
        // Some code here...
        closeRemoteInputStream(remoteCall);
        // More code here...
    }
    
    private void closeRemoteInputStream(RemoteCall remoteCall) {
        try {
            remoteCall.getInputStream().close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle the exception appropriately
        }
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've created a new private method `closeRemoteInputStream()` that replaces the call to `remoteCall.releaseInputStream()`. The new method uses the `getInputStream()` method to retrieve the input stream associated with the remote call and then calls the `close()` method on the stream to release it.

Note that the `close()` method may throw an `IOException`, so you should handle the exception appropriately.
