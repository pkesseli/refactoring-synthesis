The `java.rmi.server.RemoteCall.releaseOutputStream()` method is used to release the output stream associated with this remote call. It has been deprecated since Java 1.2, and is no longer recommended for use.

Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to replace the deprecated method with a new one:

Before refactoring:

```java
RemoteCall remoteCall = ... // obtain RemoteCall instance
OutputStream outputStream = remoteCall.getOutputStream();
// use outputStream for writing data
remoteCall.releaseOutputStream();
```

After refactoring:

```java
RemoteCall remoteCall = ... // obtain RemoteCall instance
OutputStream outputStream = remoteCall.getOutputStream();
// use outputStream for writing data
remoteCall.done();
```

The `done()` method has been introduced to replace the deprecated `releaseOutputStream()` method. It releases the resources associated with the remote call, including the output stream. You should use it instead of `releaseOutputStream()` to ensure that your code is up to date and doesn't use deprecated APIs.
