Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.rmi.server.RemoteRef.done(RemoteCall)` method.

First, let's understand the purpose of the `done(RemoteCall)` method. This method is called by the remote object's reference when a remote method call has completed. The implementation of this method is responsible for releasing any resources associated with the call.

To refactor code that uses this method, we can use the `java.rmi.server.RemoteObject` class's `remoteEquals` and `remoteHashCode` methods instead. These methods provide a way to compare and hash remote object references without using the `done(RemoteCall)` method.

Here's an example of how to refactor a class that implements `java.rmi.server.RemoteRef`:

```
public class MyRemoteRef implements RemoteRef {
    // ... implementation of RemoteRef methods ...

    // deprecated method that needs to be refactored
    @Override
    public void done(RemoteCall call) throws RemoteException {
        // release resources associated with the call
        // ...
    }

    // refactored implementation using remoteEquals and remoteHashCode methods
    @Override
    public boolean remoteEquals(RemoteRef obj) {
        // compare remote references using remoteEquals method
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public int remoteHashCode() {
        // hash remote reference using remoteHashCode method
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this example, we have replaced the implementation of the deprecated `done(RemoteCall)` method with the `remoteEquals` and `remoteHashCode` methods. We can now use these methods to compare and hash remote object references without relying on the deprecated `done(RemoteCall)` method.

Note that the exact implementation of the `remoteEquals` and `remoteHashCode` methods will depend on the specific requirements of your application. However, in general, you can use these methods to implement the necessary functionality without relying on the deprecated `done(RemoteCall)` method.
