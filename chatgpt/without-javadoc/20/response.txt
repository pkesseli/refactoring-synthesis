The `java.awt.Component.handleEvent(Event)` method is deprecated because it is part of the old, pre-1.1 event handling system in Java AWT. The preferred way of handling events in modern Java applications is using the 1.1+ event model, which involves registering event listeners with components.

Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `Component.handleEvent` to use the newer event handling model:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    public MyComponent() {
        enableEvents(AWTEvent.MOUSE_EVENT_MASK);
    }

    public void handleEvent(Event e) {
        if (e.id == Event.MOUSE_DOWN) {
            // Do something when the mouse is pressed
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component implements MouseListener {
    public MyComponent() {
        addMouseListener(this);
    }

    public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
        // Do something when the mouse is pressed
    }

    public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {}
    public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {}
    public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {}
    public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {}
}
```

In the refactored code, we have implemented the `MouseListener` interface and added ourselves as a listener to the component using `addMouseListener()`. We then override the `mousePressed()` method to perform the action we want when the mouse is pressed.

This approach is generally considered more robust and easier to maintain than the old `Component.handleEvent` method.
