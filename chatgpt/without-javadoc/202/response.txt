Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.rmi.server.RemoteStub.setRefâ€‹(RemoteStub, RemoteRef)` method in Java.

Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the `setRef()` method:

```java
// Old code using deprecated setRef() method
RemoteStub stub = ...; // get a reference to a RemoteStub
RemoteRef ref = ...; // get a reference to a RemoteRef
stub.setRef(stub, ref); // set the RemoteRef on the RemoteStub
```

Here's an example of how you could refactor the code to use the replacement method, `java.rmi.server.RemoteStub.exportObject(Remote)`:

```java
// Refactored code using exportObject() method
Remote remoteObject = ...; // get a reference to the remote object
RemoteStub stub = new RemoteStub(); // create a new RemoteStub
RemoteRef ref = remoteObject.exportObject(stub); // export the remote object with the RemoteStub
```

In this refactored code, we create a new `RemoteStub` object and then use the `exportObject()` method on the remote object to export it with the `RemoteStub`. This method returns a `RemoteRef` object, which can be used to communicate with the remote object.

By refactoring the code in this way, we avoid using the deprecated `setRef()` method and use the recommended approach instead.
