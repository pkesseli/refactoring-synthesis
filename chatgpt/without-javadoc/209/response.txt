Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.security.Security.getAlgorithmPropertyâ€‹(String, String)` method:

Before refactoring:
```
String propertyValue = Security.getAlgorithmProperty("MessageDigest", "MD5");
```

After refactoring:
```
String propertyValue = Security.getProperty("security.provider.1.MessageDigest.MD5");
```

Explanation:

The `Security.getAlgorithmProperty(String, String)` method is deprecated because it was specific to a particular provider, which was not flexible enough for different providers. Instead, you can use the `Security.getProperty(String)` method, which returns the value of the specified security property.

To get the value of the "MD5" algorithm for the "MessageDigest" service, you can use the property key "security.provider.1.MessageDigest.MD5", which specifies the first provider that supports the "MessageDigest" service and the "MD5" algorithm. Note that this property key may be different for different providers, so you may need to adjust it accordingly.

Also, keep in mind that the `Security.getProperty(String)` method returns `null` if the specified property is not set or is not available, so you should handle this case appropriately in your code.
