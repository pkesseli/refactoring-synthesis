Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `getHours()` method of the `java.sql.Date` class:

```
// Create a new Date object
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(System.currentTimeMillis());

// Get the hours from the date using the deprecated getHours() method
int hours = date.getHours();

// Refactor the code to use the Calendar class instead
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.setTime(date);
int hours = calendar.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);
```

In this refactored code, we create a `Calendar` object and set its time to the same value as the `Date` object. We then get the hours from the `Calendar` object using the `get()` method with the `HOUR_OF_DAY` constant.

Note that the `getHours()` method returns the hour in the range 0-23, while `HOUR_OF_DAY` returns the hour in the range 0-24. So you may need to adjust your code accordingly.
