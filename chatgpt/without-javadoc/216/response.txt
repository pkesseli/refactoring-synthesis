Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `getMinutes()` method of the `java.sql.Date` class:

```java
import java.sql.Date;

public class DateRefactorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date now = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
        int minutes = now.getMinutes(); // deprecated method
        
        // Refactored code using Calendar class
        java.util.Calendar calendar = java.util.Calendar.getInstance();
        calendar.setTime(now);
        int minutesRefactored = calendar.get(java.util.Calendar.MINUTE);
        
        System.out.println("Minutes: " + minutes);
        System.out.println("Minutes (refactored): " + minutesRefactored);
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a `java.sql.Date` object named `now` using the current system time. We then use the deprecated `getMinutes()` method to get the minutes of the current time.

To refactor this code, we can use the `java.util.Calendar` class instead. We first create a `Calendar` object and set its time to the `now` date using the `setTime()` method. We can then use the `get()` method of the `Calendar` class to get the minutes using the constant `java.util.Calendar.MINUTE`.

We then print both the original `minutes` variable and the refactored `minutesRefactored` variable to compare the results.

Note that the `java.util.Calendar` class is also an older class that has been replaced by the newer `java.time` classes in Java 8 and later. If you're using Java 8 or later, you may want to consider using the `java.time` classes instead.
