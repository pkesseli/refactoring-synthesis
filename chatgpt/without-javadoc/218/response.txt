Sure, I can show you an example of refactoring the deprecated method `java.sql.Date.setHours(int)`.

The `setHours(int)` method is deprecated because it sets the hour of the day using the default time zone of the JVM, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, you should use the `java.time` package to work with dates and times.

Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the `setHours(int)` method to use the `java.time` package instead:

```java
// Old code using deprecated method
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
date.setHours(12);

// Refactored code using java.time
java.time.LocalDateTime dateTime = java.time.LocalDateTime.now();
dateTime = dateTime.withHour(12);
java.sql.Date date = java.sql.Date.valueOf(dateTime.toLocalDate());
```

In the refactored code, we create a `LocalDateTime` object using the `now()` method of the `java.time` package. We then set the hour of the day to 12 using the `withHour(int)` method. Finally, we create a `java.sql.Date` object using the `valueOf(LocalDate)` method and passing in the date portion of the `LocalDateTime` object.

By using the `java.time` package, we have more control over the time zone and can avoid unexpected behavior caused by the default time zone of the JVM.
