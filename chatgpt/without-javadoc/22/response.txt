Sure, here's an example refactoring that replaces the use of the deprecated `java.awt.Component.inside(int, int)` method with a recommended alternative.

Suppose we have a `MyComponent` class that extends `java.awt.Component`, and we want to check if a given point is inside the component's bounds. Here's the original code using the deprecated `inside(int, int)` method:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    // ...
    
    public boolean containsPoint(int x, int y) {
        return inside(x, y);
    }
}
```

To refactor this code, we can replace the call to `inside(int, int)` with a call to the `java.awt.Rectangle.contains(int, int)` method, which provides the same functionality but is not deprecated. Here's the refactored code:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    // ...
    
    public boolean containsPoint(int x, int y) {
        Rectangle bounds = getBounds();
        return bounds.contains(x, y);
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we obtain the bounds of the component using the `getBounds()` method, which returns a `java.awt.Rectangle` object representing the component's bounds. We then call the `contains(int, int)` method of the `Rectangle` object to check if the given point is inside the component's bounds.

Note that this refactored code is not only using a non-deprecated method, but also it's following the recommended best practice of using `Rectangle.contains(int, int)` method for checking if a point is inside the bounds of a rectangle.
