Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `getBigDecimal(int, int)` method in Java:

```java
// Using the deprecated method
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE id = 123");
BigDecimal salary = resultSet.getBigDecimal(1, 2);

// Refactored using the new method
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE id = 123");
BigDecimal salary = resultSet.getBigDecimal("salary").setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
```

In the refactored code, we use the `getBigDecimal(String)` method instead of the deprecated `getBigDecimal(int, int)` method. We also use the `setScale(int, RoundingMode)` method to round the `BigDecimal` value to two decimal places.

Note that we pass the name of the column instead of the column index to the `getBigDecimal(String)` method, which makes the code more readable and less error-prone, especially when dealing with large result sets or queries that involve joins.
