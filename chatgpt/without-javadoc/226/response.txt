Certainly! Here's an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `getUnicodeStream(int)` method in Java's `ResultSet` class:

Before refactoring:
```java
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = 1");
while (resultSet.next()) {
  String name = resultSet.getString("name");
  InputStream unicodeStream = resultSet.getUnicodeStream(2); // Deprecated method
  String email = convertStreamToString(unicodeStream);
  System.out.println(name + ": " + email);
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = 1");
while (resultSet.next()) {
  String name = resultSet.getString("name");
  Reader reader = resultSet.getCharacterStream(2);
  String email = convertReaderToString(reader);
  System.out.println(name + ": " + email);
}

// Conversion utility method for Reader to String
private static String convertReaderToString(Reader reader) throws IOException {
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
  char[] buffer = new char[4096];
  int numChars;
  while ((numChars = reader.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) != -1) {
    sb.append(buffer, 0, numChars);
  }
  return sb.toString();
}
```

Explanation:
The `getUnicodeStream(int)` method is deprecated because it returns an InputStream, which can cause character encoding issues. The recommended replacement is to use the `getCharacterStream(int)` method, which returns a Reader. A Reader is a character stream that automatically handles character encoding, making it a safer choice for reading textual data.

In the refactored code, we replace the call to `getUnicodeStream(2)` with `getCharacterStream(2)`. We also update the `convertStreamToString` method to `convertReaderToString` to accept a Reader object, and modify it to read the character stream using a Reader instead of an InputStream. This ensures that the character encoding is handled correctly when converting the character stream to a String.
