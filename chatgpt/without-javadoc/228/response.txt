Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.sql.Time.getDate()` method:

Before refactoring:
```java
import java.sql.Time;
import java.util.Date;

public class Example {
  public void someMethod(Time time) {
    Date date = time.getDate(); // Deprecated method
    // Do something with date
  }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
import java.sql.Time;
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;

public class Example {
  public void someMethod(Time time) {
    Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
    calendar.setTime(time);
    Date date = calendar.getTime();
    // Do something with date
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, we first create a `Calendar` object and set its time to the `Time` object passed to the method. Then we get a `Date` object from the `Calendar` object, which gives us the same result as the deprecated `getDate()` method. This code should work just as well as the original code, but without using a deprecated method.
