Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.sql.Time.getDay()` method. 

Firstly, let's understand why the method is deprecated. According to the Java documentation, the `getDay()` method returns the day of the week for a `java.sql.Time` object, which is not useful for most applications since a `Time` object only represents a time of day, not a date. Therefore, the method has been deprecated to discourage its use and to encourage developers to use the `java.time` package instead.

To refactor the `getDay()` method, we can use the `LocalTime` class from the `java.time` package, which provides a similar functionality. Here's an example:

```java
import java.time.LocalTime;

public class TimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
        int hour = time.getHour();
        int minute = time.getMinute();
        int second = time.getSecond();
        
        // Print the time
        System.out.println("Current time: " + hour + ":" + minute + ":" + second);
        
        // Get the day of the week (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
        String dayOfWeek = time.getDayOfWeek().toString();
        System.out.println("Day of the week: " + dayOfWeek);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `LocalTime` object using the `now()` method, which returns the current time. We then use the `getHour()`, `getMinute()`, and `getSecond()` methods to get the hours, minutes, and seconds of the `LocalTime` object, respectively.

To get the day of the week, we use the `getDayOfWeek()` method of the `LocalTime` class, which returns a `DayOfWeek` object. We then use the `toString()` method of the `DayOfWeek` object to convert it to a string representation of the day of the week (e.g. "MONDAY", "TUESDAY", etc.).

By using the `LocalTime` class and its methods, we can avoid using the deprecated `getDay()` method and have a more modern and flexible solution.
