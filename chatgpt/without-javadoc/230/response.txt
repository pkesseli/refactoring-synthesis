Sure, I can show you an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.sql.Time.getMonth()` method in Java. 

The `getMonth()` method was deprecated because it is not useful in the context of a Time object. Time objects only represent a time of day, not a date or a month, so there is no meaningful way to get the month from a Time object. 

To refactor this code, you should replace the `getMonth()` method call with a more appropriate method for your use case. If you need to get the month from a Java `Date` object, you can use the `getMonth()` method from the `java.util.Date` class. Alternatively, if you are working with Java 8 or later, you can use the `java.time.LocalTime` class to represent a time of day, and there is no need to get the month from the object at all.

Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the `java.sql.Time.getMonth()` method:

```java
// deprecated method call
Time time = new Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
int month = time.getMonth();

// refactored code using java.util.Date
Date date = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis());
int month = date.getMonth();

// refactored code using java.time.LocalTime (Java 8 or later)
LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
// no need to get month, as LocalTime only represents a time of day
```

In the refactored code examples, we've replaced the `java.sql.Time` object with either a `java.util.Date` object or a `java.time.LocalTime` object, depending on our needs. We've also replaced the deprecated `getMonth()` method call with the appropriate method for the new object type.
