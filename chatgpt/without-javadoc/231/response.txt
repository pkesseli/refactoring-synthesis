Sure, I can provide you with an example refactoring using the `java.time` package introduced in Java 8.

The `java.time` package provides a more comprehensive set of date and time classes that address the shortcomings of the legacy `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes. The recommended replacement for the deprecated `java.sql.Time.getYear()` method is `java.time.LocalTime`.

Here's an example refactoring that demonstrates how to replace the deprecated method with `java.time.LocalTime`:

Before refactoring:

```java
java.sql.Time time = new java.sql.Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
int year = time.getYear();
```

After refactoring:

```java
java.time.LocalTime time = java.time.LocalTime.now();
int year = time.getYear();
```

In the refactored code, we create a new instance of `java.time.LocalTime` using the `now()` method, which returns the current time. We then call the `getYear()` method on the `LocalTime` instance to obtain the year value.

Note that `java.time.LocalTime` only represents a time (hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds), so it doesn't have a year component. If you need to represent a date and time, you can use `java.time.LocalDateTime` instead.
