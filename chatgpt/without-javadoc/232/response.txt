# Response Time: 26.009740114212036
Sure! The `java.sql.Time.setDate(int)` method is deprecated because it sets the year, month, and day fields of the `Time` object to arbitrary values, which may not be what you expect. Instead, you should use the `java.sql.Time.valueOf(String)` method to create a `Time` object with the desired hour, minute, and second values.

Here's an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated `setDate` method:

```java
// Create a java.util.Date object with the desired date
Date date = new Date(1234567890000L); // January 15, 2009, 10:31:30 AM GMT

// Create a java.sql.Time object from the date
Time time = new Time(date.getTime());

// Deprecated method: set the date fields of the Time object
time.setDate(1);

// Refactored code: use valueOf to create a Time object with the desired time
Time refactoredTime = Time.valueOf("10:31:30");

// Use the refactored Time object instead of the deprecated one
System.out.println(refactoredTime.toString());
```

In this example, we create a `java.util.Date` object with the desired date and time, and then create a `java.sql.Time` object from that date using the `getTime` method. Instead of using the deprecated `setDate` method to set the date fields of the `Time` object, we use the `valueOf` method to create a `Time` object with the desired time values. Finally, we use the refactored `Time` object instead of the deprecated one in our code.
