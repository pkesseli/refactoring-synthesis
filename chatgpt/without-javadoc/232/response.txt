# Response Time: 16.275867462158203
Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example refactoring for the deprecated method `java.sql.Time.setDate(int)`.

The `setDate(int)` method sets the day of the month for a `java.sql.Time` object, but it has been deprecated because a `java.sql.Time` object should only represent a time of day, not a date.

To refactor this code, you should change the `java.sql.Time` object to a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, which represents both a date and a time. Then, you can use the `setDate(int)` method on the `java.sql.Timestamp` object to set the date.

Here's an example refactoring:

```
// Old code using deprecated java.sql.Time.setDate(int) method
java.sql.Time time = new java.sql.Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
time.setDate(15);

// Refactored code using java.sql.Timestamp and setDate(int) method
java.sql.Timestamp timestamp = new java.sql.Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
timestamp.setDate(15);
```

In this refactored code, the `java.sql.Time` object has been replaced with a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, and the `setDate(int)` method is called on the `java.sql.Timestamp` object instead. This ensures that the code is up-to-date and avoids the use of a deprecated method.
