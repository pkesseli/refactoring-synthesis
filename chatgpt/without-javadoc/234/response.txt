Sure, I can provide you with a refactoring example for the deprecated `java.sql.Time.setYear(int)` method.

First, let's understand why this method is deprecated. The `java.sql.Time` class represents a specific time of day (hours, minutes, seconds), without any reference to a particular date or time zone. The `setYear(int)` method allows you to set the year component of the time, which doesn't make sense for a time-of-day value.

Instead of using `setYear(int)`, you should use a `java.time.LocalTime` object to represent a time-of-day value, which is part of the Java 8 date and time API. `LocalTime` represents a time without any reference to a particular date or time zone.

Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `java.sql.Time.setYear(int)` to use `java.time.LocalTime` instead:

```java
// Deprecated code using java.sql.Time
java.sql.Time time = new java.sql.Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
time.setYear(2023);

// Refactored code using java.time.LocalTime
java.time.LocalTime localTime = java.time.LocalTime.now();
```

As you can see, we no longer need to set the year component since `LocalTime` only represents a time of day. If you need to convert between `java.sql.Time` and `java.time.LocalTime`, you can use the following code:

```java
// Convert java.sql.Time to java.time.LocalTime
java.sql.Time sqlTime = new java.sql.Time(System.currentTimeMillis());
java.time.LocalTime localTime = sqlTime.toLocalTime();

// Convert java.time.LocalTime to java.sql.Time
java.time.LocalTime localTime = java.time.LocalTime.now();
java.sql.Time sqlTime = java.sql.Time.valueOf(localTime);
```

In this refactored code, we're using `toLocalTime()` method to convert `java.sql.Time` to `java.time.LocalTime`, and the `valueOf()` method to convert `java.time.LocalTime` to `java.sql.Time`.
