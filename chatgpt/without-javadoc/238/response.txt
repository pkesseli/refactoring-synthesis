Sure! The `weakCompareAndSet(long expect, long update)` method of the `AtomicLong` class is deprecated in Java 16 and will be removed in a future release. Instead, you can use the `compareAndSet(long expect, long update)` method which provides the same functionality as `weakCompareAndSet` but with stronger guarantees.

Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use `compareAndSet` instead of `weakCompareAndSet`:

Before:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;

public class Example {
    private final AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong(0L);

    public void incrementCounter() {
        long oldValue;
        long newValue;
        do {
            oldValue = counter.get();
            newValue = oldValue + 1;
        } while (!counter.weakCompareAndSet(oldValue, newValue));
    }
}
```

After:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;

public class Example {
    private final AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong(0L);

    public void incrementCounter() {
        long oldValue;
        long newValue;
        do {
            oldValue = counter.get();
            newValue = oldValue + 1;
        } while (!counter.compareAndSet(oldValue, newValue));
    }
}
```

As you can see, we simply replaced `weakCompareAndSet` with `compareAndSet` in the loop condition, which provides the same functionality with stronger guarantees. The `compareAndSet` method atomically sets the value of the `AtomicLong` object to the `newValue` if the current value of the object is equal to the `expect` value, and returns `true`. If the current value of the object is not equal to the `expect` value, it leaves the object unchanged and returns `false`.
