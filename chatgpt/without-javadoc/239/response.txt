Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `AtomicLongArray.weakCompareAndSet(int, long, long)` to use `AtomicLongArray.compareAndSet(int, long, long)` instead:

Before refactoring:

```
AtomicLongArray myArray = new AtomicLongArray(10);
int index = 5;
long expectedValue = 100;
long newValue = 200;
boolean result = myArray.weakCompareAndSet(index, expectedValue, newValue);
```

After refactoring:

```
AtomicLongArray myArray = new AtomicLongArray(10);
int index = 5;
long expectedValue = 100;
long newValue = 200;
boolean result = myArray.compareAndSet(index, expectedValue, newValue);
```

In the refactored code, we simply replaced `weakCompareAndSet()` with `compareAndSet()`. `compareAndSet()` is a stronger form of the operation that guarantees atomicity and visibility of the update, whereas `weakCompareAndSet()` may not ensure visibility of the update in some situations. 

Note that `compareAndSet()` will throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if the index is out of range, whereas `weakCompareAndSet()` will not. So if your code relies on `weakCompareAndSet()` not throwing an exception in such cases, you'll need to handle the exception explicitly in the refactored code.
