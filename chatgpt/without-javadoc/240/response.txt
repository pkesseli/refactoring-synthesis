Sure! The `weakCompareAndSet` method in `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference` has been deprecated in Java 9, and it is recommended to use `compareAndSet` instead. Here is an example of how you can refactor your code to use `compareAndSet` instead of `weakCompareAndSet`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference;

public class Example {
    private AtomicReference<String> ref = new AtomicReference<>("initial value");

    public void updateIfEqual(String oldValue, String newValue) {
        ref.weakCompareAndSet(oldValue, newValue); // Deprecated method
    }
}
```

Refactored to use `compareAndSet`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference;

public class Example {
    private AtomicReference<String> ref = new AtomicReference<>("initial value");

    public void updateIfEqual(String oldValue, String newValue) {
        ref.compareAndSet(oldValue, newValue);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `updateIfEqual` method uses `weakCompareAndSet` to update the `AtomicReference` if the current value is equal to the `oldValue`. To refactor this method to use `compareAndSet`, we simply replace the deprecated method call with the equivalent `compareAndSet` call. This method will perform the same atomic update operation as before, but without using the deprecated method.

Note that `compareAndSet` returns a boolean value indicating whether the update was successful or not. You may want to handle this return value in your code to ensure that the update was performed correctly.
