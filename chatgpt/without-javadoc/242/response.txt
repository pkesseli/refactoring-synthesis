Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `finalize()` method of `ThreadPoolExecutor` in Java:

```java
// Instantiate a ThreadPoolExecutor with 10 threads
ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    10, // core pool size
    10, // maximum pool size
    60, // keep alive time for idle threads
    TimeUnit.SECONDS, // time unit for keep alive time
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<>() // queue for pending tasks
);

// Do some work using the executor

// Call the deprecated finalize() method to shut down the executor when we're done
executor.finalize();
```

Instead of using `finalize()`, we can use the `shutdown()` method to gracefully shut down the executor and wait for all tasks to complete:

```java
// Instantiate a ThreadPoolExecutor with 10 threads
ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    10, // core pool size
    10, // maximum pool size
    60, // keep alive time for idle threads
    TimeUnit.SECONDS, // time unit for keep alive time
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<>() // queue for pending tasks
);

// Do some work using the executor

// Shut down the executor when we're done
executor.shutdown();
try {
    // Wait for all tasks to complete
    executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    // Handle interrupted exception if necessary
}
```

In this refactored example, we call the `shutdown()` method to signal that we're done using the executor. We then wait for up to one minute for all tasks to complete using the `awaitTermination()` method. This ensures that all threads are stopped gracefully and any pending tasks are completed before the program exits.
