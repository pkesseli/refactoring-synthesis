Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.util.Date.getDay()` method:

Original Code:
```java
import java.util.Date;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Date today = new Date();
    int dayOfWeek = today.getDay();
    System.out.println("Today is " + getDayOfWeekAsString(dayOfWeek));
  }

  private static String getDayOfWeekAsString(int dayOfWeek) {
    switch (dayOfWeek) {
      case 0:
        return "Sunday";
      case 1:
        return "Monday";
      case 2:
        return "Tuesday";
      case 3:
        return "Wednesday";
      case 4:
        return "Thursday";
      case 5:
        return "Friday";
      case 6:
        return "Saturday";
      default:
        return "";
    }
  }
}
```

Refactored Code:
```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
    DayOfWeek dayOfWeek = today.getDayOfWeek();
    System.out.println("Today is " + dayOfWeek.toString());
  }
}
```

Explanation:
In the original code, `java.util.Date` is used to get the day of the week using `getDay()`, which is a deprecated method. To refactor the code, we can use the newer `java.time.LocalDate` class and its `getDayOfWeek()` method to get the day of the week. We can then use the `toString()` method on the `DayOfWeek` enum to get the name of the day of the week.

Note: In Java 8 and earlier versions, you can use `java.time.LocalDateTime` instead of `java.time.LocalDate` to get the current date and time. However, starting from Java 9, `java.time.LocalDate` and `java.time.LocalTime` have been recommended to use for date and time operations.
