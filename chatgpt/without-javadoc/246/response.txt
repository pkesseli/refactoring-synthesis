Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `getMinutes()` method in Java's `Date` class:

Before refactoring:
```java
import java.util.Date;

public class DeprecatedDateExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Date now = new Date();
    int minutes = now.getMinutes();
    System.out.println("Current minute: " + minutes);
  }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class RefactoredDateExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
    int minutes = now.getMinute();
    System.out.println("Current minute: " + minutes);
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the use of the `Date` class with the `LocalDateTime` class from Java's new date and time API. Instead of calling the deprecated `getMinutes()` method, we're now calling the `getMinute()` method on a `LocalDateTime` instance to retrieve the minute component of the current time.

Note that this refactoring assumes that you're using Java 8 or later, which introduced the new date and time API. If you're using an earlier version of Java, you might need to use a different approach to refactor your code.
