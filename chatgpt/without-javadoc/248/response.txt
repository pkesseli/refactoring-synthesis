Sure! The `java.util.Date.getSeconds()` method is deprecated because it returns the seconds of the minute, but it does not provide any information about the milliseconds. It is recommended to use the `java.time` package introduced in Java 8 as it provides a more comprehensive and flexible approach to handling date and time.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `getSeconds()` method to use the `java.time` package:

```
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class DateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
        int seconds = now.getSecond(); // Use getSecond() instead of deprecated getSeconds()
        System.out.println("Current second: " + seconds);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `LocalDateTime` class from the `java.time` package to get the current date and time. Then we are using the `getSecond()` method to get the current second. This method returns an integer value between 0 and 59 that represents the seconds of the minute, including the milliseconds.

By using the `java.time` package, we can take advantage of the many useful classes and methods it provides, such as `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`, `Duration`, and `Period`. These classes make it easy to perform date and time calculations and manipulations in a more natural and intuitive way.
