Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the recommended alternative to `java.awt.Component.keyUp(Event, int)`:

Before:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    
    public boolean keyUp(Event event, int key) {
        if (key == KeyEvent.VK_ENTER) {
            // do something
            return true;
        }
        return super.keyUp(event, key);
    }
    
}
```

After:

```java
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    
    public boolean handleKeyEvent(KeyEvent e) {
        if (e.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED && e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_ENTER) {
            // do something
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    public void processKeyEvent(KeyEvent e) {
        if (handleKeyEvent(e)) {
            e.consume();
            return;
        }
        super.processKeyEvent(e);
    }
    
}
```

In this refactored example, we replace the deprecated `java.awt.Component.keyUp(Event, int)` method with two new methods - `handleKeyEvent()` and `processKeyEvent()`. 

`handleKeyEvent()` method checks whether the event corresponds to the release of the Enter key and returns `true` if it does. Otherwise, it returns `false`. 

`processKeyEvent()` method is called whenever a key event occurs on the component. It first checks if the event is handled by `handleKeyEvent()`. If it is, it consumes the event using `e.consume()` and returns. If it's not, it calls the `super.processKeyEvent(e)` method to handle the event as usual.

By using these new methods, we have effectively replaced the deprecated `java.awt.Component.keyUp(Event, int)` method and ensured that our code will work with newer versions of Java without issue.
