Sure, I'd be happy to show you an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.util.Date.setMinutes(int)` method.

Instead of using the deprecated `setMinutes` method, you can use the `java.util.Calendar` class which provides a method `set(int field, int value)` for setting various date and time fields. Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `setMinutes`:

Before refactoring:
```
Date date = new Date();
date.setMinutes(30);
```

After refactoring:
```
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.setTime(new Date());
calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 30);
Date date = calendar.getTime();
```

In the refactored code, we create a new instance of `Calendar` using the `Calendar.getInstance()` method, and set the time of the `Calendar` object to the current date and time using the `setTime(Date)` method. We then set the `MINUTE` field using the `set(int field, int value)` method, and finally get the updated `Date` object using the `getTime()` method.

By using `Calendar` instead of `Date`, we have eliminated the use of the deprecated `setMinutes` method and replaced it with a more modern and maintainable approach.
