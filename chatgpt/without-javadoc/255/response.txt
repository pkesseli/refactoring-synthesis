Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `setMonth` method of the `java.util.Date` class:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.util.Date;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date date = new Date();
        date.setMonth(5); // Deprecated method
        System.out.println(date);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        date = date.withMonth(5);
        System.out.println(date);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the use of the `Date` class with the newer `LocalDate` class from the `java.time` package. We also replaced the deprecated `setMonth` method with the `withMonth` method of the `LocalDate` class.

Note that the `withMonth` method returns a new `LocalDate` object with the specified month value, rather than modifying the original object like `setMonth` did. This is because the `LocalDate` class is immutable, which means its state cannot be changed once it is created. Instead, all of its methods return a new instance of the class with the requested changes applied.
