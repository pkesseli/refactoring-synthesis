Sure! The `java.util.Date.setYear(int)` method is deprecated because it sets the year relative to 1900, which can lead to confusion and errors in code. Instead, it is recommended to use the `java.util.Calendar` class or the newer `java.time` package introduced in Java 8.

Here's an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `setYear(int)` method with the `java.time.Year` class:

```java
// Deprecated code
Date date = new Date();
date.setYear(2022); // Deprecated method

// Refactored code using java.time.Year
LocalDate localDate = LocalDate.now();
Year year = Year.of(2022);
LocalDate newDate = localDate.withYear(year.getValue());
```

In the refactored code, we use `LocalDate.now()` to get the current date, and then create a `java.time.Year` object with the desired year value. Finally, we use the `withYear(int year)` method to create a new `LocalDate` object with the specified year.

Note that `java.time.Year` is immutable, so we create a new instance of `LocalDate` with the desired year using the `withYear()` method. If you need to modify other fields in a date, such as the month or day, you can use the corresponding `withMonth()` and `withDayOfMonth()` methods.
