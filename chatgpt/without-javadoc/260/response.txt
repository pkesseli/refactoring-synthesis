Certainly! The `java.util.Date.UTC(int, int, int, int, int, int)` method is deprecated because it is recommended to use `java.time.Instant` instead. Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use `java.time.Instant` instead of `java.util.Date.UTC(int, int, int, int, int, int)`:

Before:

```
int year = 2023;
int month = 3;
int day = 4;
int hour = 12;
int minute = 30;
int second = 0;

long milliseconds = Date.UTC(year - 1900, month - 1, day, hour, minute, second);
Date date = new Date(milliseconds);
```

After:

```
int year = 2023;
int month = 3;
int day = 4;
int hour = 12;
int minute = 30;
int second = 0;

Instant instant = Instant.ofEpochSecond(
    LocalDateTime.of(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
        .toEpochSecond(ZoneOffset.UTC));
Date date = Date.from(instant);
```

In this refactored code, we are first creating a `LocalDateTime` object using the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second variables. Then, we are converting this `LocalDateTime` object to the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) using the `toEpochSecond` method with `ZoneOffset.UTC`. Finally, we are creating an `Instant` object using this number of seconds, and then creating a `Date` object from the `Instant` object using the `from` method.
