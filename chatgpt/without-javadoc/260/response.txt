Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.util.Date.UTC(int, int, int, int, int, int)` method using the `java.time` package introduced in Java 8:

```
// Deprecated method usage
Date deprecatedDate = new Date(Date.UTC(2023, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0));
System.out.println(deprecatedDate);

// Refactored code using java.time
Instant instant = LocalDateTime.of(2023, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0)
        .atZone(ZoneOffset.UTC)
        .toInstant();
Date newDate = Date.from(instant);
System.out.println(newDate);
```

In the above code snippet, we are creating a new `Date` object using the deprecated `java.util.Date.UTC(int, int, int, int, int, int)` method, which is used to create a UTC `Date` object by specifying the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values.

To refactor this code using `java.time`, we first create a `LocalDateTime` object with the same year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values. We then convert this `LocalDateTime` object to a `ZonedDateTime` object by specifying the `ZoneOffset.UTC` time zone.

Finally, we get the `Instant` representation of this `ZonedDateTime` object and use the `Date.from()` method to convert it to a `java.util.Date` object. This gives us a new `Date` object that represents the same date and time in UTC.

Note that using `java.time` is recommended over using the deprecated `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes as it provides more modern and efficient APIs for working with dates and times in Java.
