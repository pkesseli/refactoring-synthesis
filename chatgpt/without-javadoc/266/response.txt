Sure, I can provide you with an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated method `java.util.logging.LogRecord.setMillis(long)`.

Before we start, let's understand why this method is deprecated. According to the Java documentation, this method has been deprecated because it is inherently unsafe: it can be used to modify the LogRecord object after it has been created, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To refactor code that uses this method, you should use the constructor of the `LogRecord` class that takes a `long` value as a parameter instead. Here's an example:

```java
// Before refactoring
LogRecord record = new LogRecord(Level.INFO, "This is a log message");
record.setMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());

// After refactoring
LogRecord record = new LogRecord(Level.INFO, "This is a log message", System.currentTimeMillis());
```

In the refactored code, we are using the `LogRecord` constructor that takes a `long` value as the third parameter. This allows us to set the timestamp of the log message without using the deprecated `setMillis()` method.

By making this change, we avoid the use of the deprecated method and ensure that our code is safe and maintainable.
