Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the `java.util.Properties.save(OutputStream, String)` method, which is deprecated:

```java
// Old code using deprecated method
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("key", "value");

try (OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("config.properties")) {
    props.save(outputStream, "Configuration file");
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

To refactor this code, we need to replace the deprecated `save` method with a non-deprecated alternative. One such alternative is to use the `store` method, which takes a `Writer` instead of an `OutputStream`. Here's how the code can be refactored using the `store` method:

```java
// New code using non-deprecated method
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("key", "value");

try (Writer writer = new FileWriter("config.properties")) {
    props.store(writer, "Configuration file");
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this refactored code, we create a `Writer` object using `FileWriter` and pass it to the `store` method. We also provide a description of the configuration file as the second argument to the `store` method, which is equivalent to the `comment` argument of the deprecated `save` method.
