Sure, here is an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated `finalize()` method in `javax.imageio.spi.ServiceRegistry`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.imageio.spi.ServiceRegistry;

public class ImageIOManager {
    private ServiceRegistry registry;
    
    public ImageIOManager() {
        registry = ServiceRegistry.getInstance();
    }
    
    // Other methods...
    
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        registry.dispose();
        super.finalize();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.imageio.spi.ServiceRegistry;

public class ImageIOManager implements AutoCloseable {
    private ServiceRegistry registry;
    
    public ImageIOManager() {
        registry = ServiceRegistry.getInstance();
    }
    
    // Other methods...
    
    @Override
    public void close() throws Exception {
        registry.dispose();
    }
}
```

Explanation:

In the original code, the `finalize()` method is overridden to dispose of the `ServiceRegistry` object when the `ImageIOManager` object is garbage collected. However, this approach is not reliable as it is not guaranteed when the `finalize()` method will be called.

To address this issue, the `AutoCloseable` interface can be implemented and its `close()` method can be overridden to dispose of the `ServiceRegistry` object in a more reliable way. The `try-with-resources` statement can be used to ensure that the `close()` method is always called when the `ImageIOManager` object is no longer needed.

Note that `AutoCloseable` is a functional interface that is used for resources that need to be closed when they are no longer needed, so it is a good fit for this situation.
