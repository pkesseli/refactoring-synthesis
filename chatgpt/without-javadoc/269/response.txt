Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor the `finalize()` method in `FileCacheImageInputStream` class to avoid using the deprecated method:

Before refactoring:
```java
public class MyImageIO {

    public void readImage(String filename) throws IOException {
        FileCacheImageInputStream imageInputStream = new FileCacheImageInputStream(new FileInputStream(filename), null);
        // code to read image from the input stream
        // ...
        imageInputStream.finalize();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
public class MyImageIO {

    public void readImage(String filename) throws IOException {
        try (FileCacheImageInputStream imageInputStream = new FileCacheImageInputStream(new FileInputStream(filename), null)) {
            // code to read image from the input stream
            // ...
        } catch (Throwable t) {
            // handle any exceptions or errors thrown during the processing of the imageInputStream
            t.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, the `FileCacheImageInputStream` object is created inside a try-with-resources block. This ensures that the `FileCacheImageInputStream` object will be closed automatically after the try block finishes executing, whether or not an exception is thrown.

Additionally, since the `finalize()` method is deprecated, it is not called explicitly in the refactored code. Instead, any exceptions or errors that occur during the processing of the `FileCacheImageInputStream` object are caught and handled in the catch block.
