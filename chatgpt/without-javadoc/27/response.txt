Sure, here's an example refactoring using the `java.awt.Component.locate(int, int)` method, which is deprecated since Java 9:

```java
// Deprecated code
Component comp = ...; // Some component
comp.locate(x, y); // Using deprecated method to locate the component
```

The `locate(int, int)` method is deprecated because it doesn't take into account the possibility of the component being inside a container with a non-zero origin. Instead, you should use the `getLocation()` method to get the component's location relative to its parent container.

Here's how you can refactor the code to use `getLocation()` instead:

```java
// Refactored code
Component comp = ...; // Some component
Point location = comp.getLocation(); // Getting the component's location
location.translate(x, y); // Translating the location by the specified offsets
comp.setLocation(location); // Setting the new location for the component
```

In the refactored code, we first get the current location of the component using `getLocation()`, which returns a `Point` object representing the location of the component relative to its parent container. We then use the `translate(int, int)` method of the `Point` object to translate the location by the specified offsets `x` and `y`. Finally, we set the new location for the component using `setLocation(Point)`. This refactored code is more robust and will work correctly even if the component is inside a container with a non-zero origin.
