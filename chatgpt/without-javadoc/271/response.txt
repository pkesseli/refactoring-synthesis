Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `javax.imageio.stream.FileImageOutputStream.finalize()` method, which is now deprecated:

Before Refactoring:

```java
import javax.imageio.stream.FileImageOutputStream;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ImageWriter {
    public void writeImageToFile(byte[] imageBytes, String fileName) throws IOException {
        FileImageOutputStream imageOutputStream = new FileImageOutputStream(new File(fileName));
        imageOutputStream.write(imageBytes);
        imageOutputStream.finalize(); // Deprecated method
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```java
import javax.imageio.stream.FileImageOutputStream;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ImageWriter {
    public void writeImageToFile(byte[] imageBytes, String fileName) throws IOException {
        try (FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(new File(fileName))) {
            fileOutputStream.write(imageBytes);
        }
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the `FileImageOutputStream` class with `FileOutputStream` to write the image bytes to a file. We are also using a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the `FileOutputStream` when we are done with it, which ensures that the underlying file is closed properly.

Note that if you need to use `FileImageOutputStream` for any reason, you can replace the call to `imageOutputStream.finalize()` with a call to `imageOutputStream.close()`, which has the same effect of closing the underlying file and releasing any system resources associated with the stream.
