Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the use of `finalize()` in `javax.imageio.stream.ImageInputStreamImpl`:

1. Replace `finalize()` with `close()`: Since `finalize()` is deprecated, you can replace it with the `close()` method, which is used to release any resources allocated by the object. In this case, you can call `close()` to release any system resources held by the `ImageInputStreamImpl` object. Here's an example of how you can modify the code:

Before:

```java
public class MyImageInputStream extends ImageInputStreamImpl {
    ...
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        super.finalize();
        close();
    }
    ...
}
```

After:

```java
public class MyImageInputStream extends ImageInputStreamImpl {
    ...
    public void close() throws IOException {
        super.close();
        // Release any other resources held by this object
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

2. Implement `AutoCloseable`: The `AutoCloseable` interface was introduced in Java 7 to provide a standard way of releasing resources. You can modify your code to implement the `AutoCloseable` interface, which defines a single method `close()` that can be used to release resources. Here's an example of how you can modify the code:

Before:

```java
public class MyImageInputStream extends ImageInputStreamImpl {
    ...
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        super.finalize();
        close();
    }
    ...
}
```

After:

```java
public class MyImageInputStream extends ImageInputStreamImpl implements AutoCloseable {
    ...
    public void close() throws IOException {
        super.close();
        // Release any other resources held by this object
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

By implementing the `AutoCloseable` interface, you can use a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the `MyImageInputStream` object is closed properly:

```java
try (MyImageInputStream in = new MyImageInputStream()) {
    // Use the image input stream here
}
```

This will automatically call the `close()` method on the `MyImageInputStream` object when the try block is exited, ensuring that any resources held by the object are properly released.
