Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the `javax.imageio.stream.MemoryCacheImageInputStream.finalize()` method, which is deprecated:

Before:
```java
public class MyImageReader {
    private MemoryCacheImageInputStream input;

    public MyImageReader(InputStream stream) {
        input = new MemoryCacheImageInputStream(stream);
    }

    // some other methods...

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            input.close();
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

After:
```java
public class MyImageReader implements Closeable {
    private MemoryCacheImageInputStream input;

    public MyImageReader(InputStream stream) {
        input = new MemoryCacheImageInputStream(stream);
    }

    // some other methods...

    @Override
    public void close() throws IOException {
        input.close();
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we implement the `Closeable` interface and provide an implementation of the `close()` method. This method is called explicitly when the resource needs to be closed, rather than relying on the garbage collector to invoke `finalize()`.

Now, instead of relying on the `finalize()` method to release resources, the caller can simply invoke `close()` on the `MyImageReader` instance when they are done with it, and the `MemoryCacheImageInputStream` instance will be properly closed and released.

Note that in the refactored code, we are no longer overriding the `finalize()` method, as it is deprecated and should not be used.
