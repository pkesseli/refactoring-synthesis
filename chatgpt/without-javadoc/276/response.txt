Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor the use of the deprecated `javax.management.MBeanServer.deserializeâ€‹(String, ObjectName, byte[])` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
MBeanServer mbeanServer = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyMBean");
byte[] serializedData = // obtain serialized data from somewhere

MyMBean mbean = (MyMBean) mbeanServer.deserialize("com.example.MyMBean", objectName, serializedData);
```

After refactoring:

```java
MBeanServer mbeanServer = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyMBean");
byte[] serializedData = // obtain serialized data from somewhere

MyMBean mbean = null;
try (ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(serializedData)) {
    try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bis)) {
        mbean = (MyMBean) ois.readObject();
    }
}

mbeanServer.registerMBean(mbean, objectName);
```

In this refactored code, we first obtain the serialized data as before. However, instead of using the deprecated `deserialize()` method to deserialize the data, we use a `ByteArrayInputStream` and an `ObjectInputStream` to deserialize the data into an instance of `MyMBean`. We then register the deserialized MBean with the `MBeanServer` using the `registerMBean()` method. 

Note that in this refactored code, we are assuming that `MyMBean` implements the `javax.management.DynamicMBean` interface, which is the interface typically implemented by MBeans that are created dynamically at runtime. If `MyMBean` implements a different MBean interface, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
