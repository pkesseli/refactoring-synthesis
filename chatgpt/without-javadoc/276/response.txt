Sure, I can provide you with an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `javax.management.MBeanServer.deserialize(String, ObjectName, byte[])`.

Before I give you the example, it's important to note that the reason this method has been deprecated is because it can be a security risk if used improperly. Deserializing objects from an untrusted source can lead to remote code execution attacks. Therefore, it's recommended to use a safer approach to achieve the same functionality.

One alternative approach is to use a `javax.management.loading.ClassLoaderRepository` to load the class and then use reflection to create an instance of the class.

Here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated method:

```java
// Deprecated method
public Object deserialize(String className, ObjectName loaderName, byte[] data) throws InstanceNotFoundException, OperationsException, ReflectionException;

// Refactored method
public Object createInstance(String className, ClassLoader classLoader) throws ClassNotFoundException, IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException {
    Class<?> clazz = Class.forName(className, true, classLoader);
    return clazz.newInstance();
}
```

This new method creates an instance of a class given its fully qualified name and a `ClassLoader` instance. You can obtain the `ClassLoader` instance by using the `javax.management.loading.ClassLoaderRepository` interface, which can be obtained from the `javax.management.MBeanServer`. Here's an example of how to use this new method:

```java
// Obtain the ClassLoader instance
ClassLoaderRepository clr = mbeanServer.getClassLoaderRepository();
ClassLoader classLoader = clr.getClassLoader(objectName);

// Create an instance of the class
Object instance = createInstance("com.example.MyClass", classLoader);
```

In this example, `mbeanServer` is an instance of `javax.management.MBeanServer` and `objectName` is an instance of `javax.management.ObjectName` representing the MBean whose class you want to create an instance of. 

Note that this approach assumes that the class being deserialized has a default (no-argument) constructor. If the class requires constructor arguments, you can use reflection to create an instance of the class using the appropriate constructor. However, you should be careful not to expose any sensitive information in the constructor arguments.
