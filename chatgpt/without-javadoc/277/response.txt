Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `deserialize` method in the `javax.management.MBeanServer` interface:

```
import javax.management.MBeanServer;
import javax.management.ObjectName;

public class Example {

  private MBeanServer mbeanServer;

  public void deserializeExample(ObjectName objectName, byte[] serializedObject) throws Exception {
    Object obj = mbeanServer.deserialize(objectName, serializedObject);
    // Do something with the deserialized object
  }

}
```

To refactor this code, you can replace the deprecated `deserialize` method with the `deserialize` method of the `javax.management.loading.MLet` class. Here's the refactored code:

```
import javax.management.loading.MLet;
import javax.management.ObjectName;

public class Example {

  private MLet mlet;

  public void deserializeExample(ObjectName objectName, byte[] serializedObject) throws Exception {
    Object obj = mlet.getMBeanFromBytes(serializedObject);
    // Do something with the deserialized object
  }

}
```

In this refactored code, we create an instance of the `MLet` class and use its `getMBeanFromBytes` method to deserialize the object from the byte array. This method provides the same functionality as the deprecated `deserialize` method but is not marked as deprecated.

Note that you will need to update your dependencies to include the `javax.management.loading.MLet` class.
