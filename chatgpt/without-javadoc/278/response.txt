Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor.getDerivedGauge()` to use the recommended alternative:

Before refactoring:
```java
CounterMonitor monitor = new CounterMonitor();
// set up monitor properties, including observed MBean and counter attribute
monitor.start();
Double derivedGauge = monitor.getDerivedGauge();
```

After refactoring:
```java
CounterMonitor monitor = new CounterMonitor();
// set up monitor properties, including observed MBean and counter attribute
monitor.start();
MBeanServer server = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
ObjectName observedObject = monitor.getObservedObject();
String counterAttributeName = monitor.getObservedAttribute();
Object counterValue = server.getAttribute(observedObject, counterAttributeName);
Double derivedGauge = monitor.getDerivedGauge(counterValue);
```

In this refactored code, instead of calling the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method, we use the `getAttribute()` method of the `MBeanServer` interface to obtain the current value of the counter attribute, and then pass that value to the `getDerivedGauge()` method of the `CounterMonitor` class to obtain the derived gauge value.
