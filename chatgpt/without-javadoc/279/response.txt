Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor your code to use the recommended replacement method for `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()`, which is `getDerivedGaugeTimestamp()`:

```
// Old code using deprecated method
CounterMonitor monitor = new CounterMonitor();
// ... set up monitor ...

// Get derived gauge timestamp
long timestamp = monitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();

// Refactored code using replacement method
CounterMonitor monitor = new CounterMonitor();
// ... set up monitor ...

// Get derived gauge timestamp
long timestamp = monitor.getDerivedGaugeTimestamp();
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` with `getDerivedGaugeTimestamp()`. This change is necessary because `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` is deprecated and may not be supported in future versions of the Java language, so it's recommended to use the replacement method instead.
