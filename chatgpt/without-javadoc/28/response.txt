Sure! The `java.awt.Component.location()` method has been deprecated since Java 9, and its use is discouraged. Instead, it is recommended to use `java.awt.Component.getLocation()` method, which provides the same functionality.

Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the `location()` method to use the `getLocation()` method instead:

```java
// Before refactoring
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
Point location = myButton.location();
System.out.println("Button location: " + location.x + ", " + location.y);

// After refactoring
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
Point location = myButton.getLocation();
System.out.println("Button location: " + location.x + ", " + location.y);
```

In this example, we simply replace the deprecated `location()` method with the recommended `getLocation()` method to retrieve the location of the button.

Note that if you are using an older version of Java that does not support the `getLocation()` method, you can still use `location()` method. However, keep in mind that its use is discouraged and it may be removed in future Java releases.
