Certainly! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method of `CounterMonitorMBean`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class CounterMonitorExample {
    private CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor;

    public void doSomething() {
        double derivedGauge = counterMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
        // Use derivedGauge for some calculation
        // ...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class CounterMonitorExample {
    private CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor;

    public void doSomething() {
        double derivedGauge = counterMonitor.getDerivedGauge(null);
        // Use derivedGauge for some calculation
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method with the `getDerivedGauge(ObjectName)` method, which has the same functionality but takes an additional parameter of type `ObjectName`. In this case, we simply pass `null` as the argument to indicate that we don't want to specify a particular `ObjectName`. This should work as a drop-in replacement for the old method.

Note that if you do need to specify an `ObjectName`, you should provide a valid object name that identifies the MBean that the counter monitor is monitoring.
