Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor the use of the deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method in the `CounterMonitorMBean` interface:

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
        long timestamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
        // Do something with the timestamp...
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CounterMonitor counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
        long timestamp = counterMonitor.getDerivedGauge().getTimestamp();
        // Do something with the timestamp...
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we create an instance of the `CounterMonitor` class instead of the `CounterMonitorMBean` interface. Then, we use the `getDerivedGauge()` method to get the `DerivedGauge` object and call the `getTimestamp()` method on it to retrieve the timestamp. This should give you the same functionality as the deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method.
