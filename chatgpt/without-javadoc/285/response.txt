Sure, here's an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean.setThresholdâ€‹(Number)` method:

Before Refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class CounterMonitorExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
        counterMonitor.setThreshold(100);
        // Other code using the counterMonitor object...
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor;
import javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean;

public class CounterMonitorExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CounterMonitorMBean counterMonitor = new CounterMonitor();
        counterMonitor.addObservedObject("myCounter");
        counterMonitor.setObservedAttribute("Count");
        counterMonitor.setNotify(false);
        counterMonitor.setInitThreshold(100);
        counterMonitor.start();
        // Other code using the counterMonitor object...
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `setThreshold` method with a combination of new methods provided by the `CounterMonitor` class. Specifically, we have used the `addObservedObject`, `setObservedAttribute`, `setNotify`, `setInitThreshold`, and `start` methods to achieve the same functionality as the deprecated `setThreshold` method.

The `addObservedObject` method specifies the object that we want to monitor, and the `setObservedAttribute` method specifies the attribute of the object that we want to monitor. In this case, we are monitoring an object with the name "myCounter" and the attribute "Count".

The `setNotify` method specifies whether or not notifications should be sent when the threshold is crossed. In this case, we have set it to false, which means no notifications will be sent.

The `setInitThreshold` method specifies the initial threshold value. This is equivalent to the threshold value we were setting with the deprecated `setThreshold` method.

Finally, the `start` method starts the monitor, which will begin monitoring the specified object and attribute for changes that cross the threshold value.

By using these new methods, we have successfully refactored the code to avoid using the deprecated `setThreshold` method.
