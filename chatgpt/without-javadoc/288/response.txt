Certainly, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method in `javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitorMBean`:

Before:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitorMBean;

public class GaugeMonitorExample {
  private GaugeMonitorMBean gaugeMonitor;

  public double getDerivedGaugeValue() {
    return gaugeMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
  }
}
```

After:

```java
import javax.management.monitor.MonitorMBean;

public class GaugeMonitorExample {
  private MonitorMBean monitor;

  public double getDerivedGaugeValue() {
    return monitor.getObservedObject();
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the use of `getDerivedGauge()` with `getObservedObject()`, which is the non-deprecated method to retrieve the observed object in the `MonitorMBean` interface. Since `GaugeMonitorMBean` is a sub-interface of `MonitorMBean`, we can still use it as an implementation of `MonitorMBean`.

Of course, the specific refactoring may depend on how the `GaugeMonitorMBean` is being used in your codebase. It's possible that you may need to refactor more than just the one method call.
