Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.lostFocus(Event, Object)` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyTextField extends TextField {
    public MyTextField() {
        super();
        addFocusListener(new FocusAdapter() {
            public void focusLost(FocusEvent e) {
                processLostFocus(e);
            }
        });
    }

    protected void processLostFocus(Event e) {
        // Do something when focus is lost
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyTextField extends TextField {
    public MyTextField() {
        super();
        addFocusListener(new FocusAdapter() {
            public void focusLost(FocusEvent e) {
                processLostFocus(e);
            }
        });
    }

    protected void processLostFocus(FocusEvent e) {
        // Do something when focus is lost
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've simply changed the type of the `Event` parameter in the `processLostFocus` method to `FocusEvent`, which is the appropriate type for the event that is being passed in. This will ensure that the code continues to work correctly even after the deprecated method is removed in a future version of Java.
