Certainly! Here's an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `getObservedObject()` method in the `javax.management.monitor.Monitor` class with a non-deprecated alternative.

Deprecated method:

```java
public synchronized Object getObservedObject()
```

Refactored method:

```java
public synchronized ObjectName getObservedObject()
```

Explanation:

The `getObservedObject()` method in the `javax.management.monitor.Monitor` class returns the object being monitored by the monitor. In earlier versions of JMX, this method returned an object of type `Object`. However, this method has been deprecated since JMX 1.2, and the recommended alternative is to use the `ObjectName` class instead.

To refactor the code, we can change the return type of the `getObservedObject()` method from `Object` to `ObjectName`. This requires a few changes to the method signature and implementation:

```java
public synchronized ObjectName getObservedObject() {
    if (observedObject instanceof ObjectName) {
        return (ObjectName) observedObject;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

In this implementation, we check if the observed object is an instance of `ObjectName`. If it is, we cast it to that type and return it. If it is not, we return `null`.

Note that this implementation assumes that the observed object is either an instance of `ObjectName` or `null`. If it is some other type, this implementation may need to be modified accordingly.
