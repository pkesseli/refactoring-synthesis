Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `getObservedObject()` method in the `javax.management.monitor.MonitorMBean` interface:

Before refactoring:
```java
MonitorMBean monitor = ...; // initialize the monitor
Object observedObject = monitor.getObservedObject();
```

After refactoring:
```java
MonitorMBean monitor = ...; // initialize the monitor
Object observedObject = null;

if (monitor instanceof javax.management.ObjectName) {
    observedObject = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().getObjectInstance((javax.management.ObjectName) monitor).getObjectName();
} else {
    observedObject = monitor.getObservedAttribute();
}
```

In the refactored code, we first check if the `monitor` object is an instance of `javax.management.ObjectName`. If it is, we use the `ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().getObjectInstance(ObjectName)` method to retrieve the `ObjectName` instance associated with the MBean, and then get the actual observed object by calling `getObjectName()` on the `ObjectInstance`.

If the `monitor` object is not an instance of `javax.management.ObjectName`, we assume that it is an instance of a different class that implements the `MonitorMBean` interface, and we retrieve the observed object using the `getObservedAttribute()` method, which is not deprecated.

By checking if the `monitor` object is an instance of `javax.management.ObjectName`, we can handle both cases where the observed object is an `ObjectName` or a different object type that implements `MonitorMBean`. This refactored code should be more future-proof and won't rely on a deprecated method.
