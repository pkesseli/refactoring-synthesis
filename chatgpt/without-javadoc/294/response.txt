Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.management.monitor.StringMonitor.getDerivedGauge()` method.

Before refactoring:

```java
StringMonitor stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
// ...
DerivedGauge derivedGauge = stringMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
// ...
```

After refactoring:

```java
StringMonitor stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
// ...
DerivedGauge derivedGauge = new DerivedGauge() {
    @Override
    public Object getValue() {
        return stringMonitor.getStringToCompare();
    }
};
// ...
```

In this refactored code, we are creating a new anonymous class that implements the `DerivedGauge` interface. This interface requires the implementation of a single method, `getValue()`, which returns the current value of the gauge.

We are using the `getStringToCompare()` method from the `StringMonitor` class to get the current value of the monitored string, and returning it as the value of the `DerivedGauge`.

By doing this, we have avoided using the deprecated `getDerivedGauge()` method and instead created our own implementation of the `DerivedGauge` interface.
