Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the replacement method for `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` in the `StringMonitor` class:

```java
// Old code using the deprecated getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp() method
StringMonitor stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
long derivedGaugeTimeStamp = stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();

// Refactored code using the replacement method: getDerivedGauge()
StringMonitor stringMonitor = new StringMonitor();
Object derivedGauge = stringMonitor.getDerivedGauge();
long derivedGaugeTimeStamp = stringMonitor.getLastUpdatedTimeStamp();
```

In the refactored code, we first create an instance of the `StringMonitor` class. Then we call the `getDerivedGauge()` method to retrieve the derived gauge value. We store this value in an `Object` variable `derivedGauge`.

Finally, to get the timestamp of when the derived gauge value was last updated, we call the `getLastUpdatedTimeStamp()` method on the `StringMonitor` object. This method returns a `long` value representing the timestamp in milliseconds since the epoch.

Note that the `getLastUpdatedTimeStamp()` method is not deprecated and is the recommended replacement for `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()`.
