Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the recommended method for obtaining the derived gauge timestamp in the `StringMonitorMBean` interface:

Before Refactoring:
```java
import javax.management.monitor.StringMonitorMBean;

public class StringMonitorExample {

  private StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor;

  public long getLastUpdatedTime() {
    return stringMonitor.getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp();
  }
}
```

After Refactoring:
```java
import javax.management.monitor.Monitor;
import javax.management.monitor.StringMonitorMBean;

public class StringMonitorExample {

  private StringMonitorMBean stringMonitor;

  public long getLastUpdatedTime() {
    Monitor monitor = (Monitor)stringMonitor;
    return monitor.getLastUpdatedTimeStamp();
  }
}
```

As you can see, we are using the `getLastUpdatedTimeStamp()` method from the `Monitor` interface instead of the deprecated `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method from the `StringMonitorMBean` interface. We cast the `StringMonitorMBean` instance to a `Monitor` instance first to access this method.

Note that the `Monitor` interface was introduced in Java SE 6, so if you are using an older version of Java, you may need to upgrade to use this approach.
