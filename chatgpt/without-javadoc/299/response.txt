Sure, here is an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `javax.management.ValueExp.setMBeanServer(MBeanServer)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.*;

public class MyValueExp extends ValueExp {
  private MBeanServer mbs;

  public void setMBeanServer(MBeanServer mbs) {
    this.mbs = mbs;
  }

  // other methods...
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.management.*;

public class MyValueExp extends ValueExp {
  private final MBeanServerConnection mbsc;

  public MyValueExp(MBeanServerConnection mbsc) {
    this.mbsc = mbsc;
  }

  // other methods...
}
```

Explanation:

In the new implementation, we no longer use the deprecated `setMBeanServer()` method. Instead, we use the `MBeanServerConnection` interface, which is not deprecated and provides the same functionality.

We pass an instance of `MBeanServerConnection` to the constructor of `MyValueExp`. This allows us to use `mbsc` in any methods that require access to the `MBeanServer`.

Note that `MBeanServerConnection` is an interface, and `MBeanServer` is a class that implements that interface. By using `MBeanServerConnection`, we allow more flexibility in our code, as we can pass in any object that implements the `MBeanServerConnection` interface, not just instances of the `MBeanServer` class.
