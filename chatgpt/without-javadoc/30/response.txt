Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.minimumSize()` method:

Before refactoring:

```
import java.awt.Component;
import javax.swing.JPanel;

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {

    public MyPanel() {
        setMinimumSize(new Dimension(100, 100)); // Deprecated method
    }

    // Other code...
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import javax.swing.JPanel;

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {

    public MyPanel() {
        setMinimumSize(getPreferredSize());
    }

    // Other code...
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the use of the deprecated `minimumSize()` method with `getPreferredSize()`. This is because the preferred size of a component is usually a good minimum size, and the `getPreferredSize()` method is not deprecated.

Note that in some cases, you might need to calculate a minimum size that is different from the preferred size. In such cases, you can create a new method that calculates the minimum size, and use that method instead of the deprecated `minimumSize()` method.
