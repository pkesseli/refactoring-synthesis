Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `setUnicodeStream` method of `javax.sql.rowset.BaseRowSet`.

Instead of using `setUnicodeStream`, you can use the `setCharacterStream` method which accepts a `Reader` object as the second parameter, instead of an `InputStream`. Here's an example of how you can refactor the code:

Before refactoring:

```
PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES(?, ?)");
pstmt.setInt(1, 100);
InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream("Hello World".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
pstmt.setUnicodeStream(2, inputStream, 11);
pstmt.executeUpdate();
```

After refactoring:

```
PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES(?, ?)");
pstmt.setInt(1, 100);
Reader reader = new StringReader("Hello World");
pstmt.setCharacterStream(2, reader, 11);
pstmt.executeUpdate();
```

As you can see, the `setUnicodeStream` method has been replaced with `setCharacterStream`, and the `InputStream` has been replaced with a `Reader`. This should work as a drop-in replacement, without any changes to the SQL statement or the index parameter.
