Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `getLabel()` method in `javax.swing.AbstractButton`:

Before refactoring:
```
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
String label = myButton.getLabel();
System.out.println("Button label: " + label);
```

After refactoring:
```
JButton myButton = new JButton("Click me");
String label = myButton.getText(); // using getText() instead of getLabel()
System.out.println("Button label: " + label);
```

In this refactored code, we've simply replaced the deprecated `getLabel()` method with the recommended `getText()` method, which has the same functionality. The `getText()` method returns the text that is displayed on the button, so it makes more sense to use it in this context.
