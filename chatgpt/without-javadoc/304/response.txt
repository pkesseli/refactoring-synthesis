Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.AbstractButton.setLabel(String)` method:

Let's say you have a `JButton` object called `myButton` and you're currently setting its label using the `setLabel()` method:

```java
myButton.setLabel("Click me");
```

To refactor this code, you can simply replace the `setLabel()` method with the `setText()` method, which is the preferred method for setting the label of a button:

```java
myButton.setText("Click me");
```

That's it! Your code now uses the recommended method and will continue to work as expected.
