Sure! The `setLabel(String)` method of `javax.swing.AbstractButton` has been deprecated since Java 7, and the preferred way to set the label for a button is to use the `setText(String)` method instead. Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use `setText(String)` instead of `setLabel(String)`:

Before refactoring:
```
JButton myButton = new JButton();
myButton.setLabel("Click me");
```

After refactoring:
```
JButton myButton = new JButton();
myButton.setText("Click me");
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the method call `setLabel("Click me")` with `setText("Click me")`. This change is simple, straightforward, and makes your code more up-to-date with the latest best practices.
