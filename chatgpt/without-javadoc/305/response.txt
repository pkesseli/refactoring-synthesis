Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the use of `javax.swing.FocusManager.disableSwingFocusManager()` method, which is deprecated, to a recommended alternative:

Deprecated Method:
```
javax.swing.FocusManager.disableSwingFocusManager();
```

Recommended Alternative:
```
javax.swing.FocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager().setDefaultFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(false);
```

Explanation:
The `javax.swing.FocusManager.disableSwingFocusManager()` method is deprecated, and its use is no longer recommended. Instead, the recommended alternative is to use `javax.swing.FocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager().setDefaultFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(false)`.

This method call disables the default focus traversal keys, which are keys used for navigating the focus among components in a GUI. By default, these keys are enabled, which means that pressing the Tab or Shift+Tab keys moves the focus to the next or previous component, respectively. By disabling the default focus traversal keys, you can prevent unwanted navigation of the focus in your GUI.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the use of the deprecated method to the recommended alternative:

Before refactoring:
```
javax.swing.FocusManager.disableSwingFocusManager();
```

After refactoring:
```
javax.swing.FocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager().setDefaultFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(false);
```

By making this change, you can update your code to use the recommended method and avoid using deprecated methods, ensuring that your code is up to date and compatible with future versions of Java.
