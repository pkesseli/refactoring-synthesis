Sure, here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.FocusManager.isFocusManagerEnabled()` method:

```java
if (FocusManager.isFocusManagerEnabled()) {
   // some code here
}
```

To refactor this code, you can replace the deprecated method with the recommended alternative, which is to use the `KeyboardFocusManager` class:

```java
KeyboardFocusManager focusManager = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager();
if (focusManager.isFocusTraversalPolicyProvider()) {
    // some code here
}
```

In this refactored code, we obtain a reference to the `KeyboardFocusManager` using the `getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager()` method, which is the recommended approach. We then use the `isFocusTraversalPolicyProvider()` method to check if the current focus owner is a focus traversal policy provider.

Note that this is just one possible refactoring approach, and the specific approach you choose may depend on your specific use case and requirements.
