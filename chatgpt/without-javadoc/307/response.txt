Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `javax.swing.InputVerifier.shouldYieldFocus(JComponent)` method. 

The `shouldYieldFocus(JComponent)` method is used to determine whether the focus can be transferred from the current component to another component. The recommended approach to replace this method is to use the `javax.swing.FocusTraversalPolicy` interface.

Here's an example refactoring of the `shouldYieldFocus(JComponent)` method using `FocusTraversalPolicy`:

```java
// Deprecated method
public boolean shouldYieldFocus(JComponent input) {
    // Deprecated implementation
}

// Refactored method
public class MyFocusTraversalPolicy extends FocusTraversalPolicy {
    
    @Override
    public Component getDefaultComponent(Container focusCycleRoot) {
        // implementation
    }

    @Override
    public Component getLastComponent(Container focusCycleRoot) {
        // implementation
    }

    @Override
    public Component getFirstComponent(Container focusCycleRoot) {
        // implementation
    }

    @Override
    public Component getComponentAfter(Container focusCycleRoot, Component aComponent) {
        // implementation
    }

    @Override
    public Component getComponentBefore(Container focusCycleRoot, Component aComponent) {
        // implementation
    }

    @Override
    public boolean accept(Component aComponent) {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

The `MyFocusTraversalPolicy` class implements the `FocusTraversalPolicy` interface, which provides methods to define the order in which components should receive focus when navigating between them. 

The `accept(Component aComponent)` method in `MyFocusTraversalPolicy` can be used to validate the current component before allowing focus to be transferred to the next component. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the component should be allowed to yield focus or not.

Once the `MyFocusTraversalPolicy` class is defined, you can set it as the focus traversal policy for your container using the `setFocusTraversalPolicy(FocusTraversalPolicy policy)` method.

Here's an example of how to use `MyFocusTraversalPolicy` to set the focus traversal policy for a container:

```java
JPanel myPanel = new JPanel();
myPanel.setFocusTraversalPolicy(new MyFocusTraversalPolicy());
```

With this refactored approach, you can handle the logic of whether to allow focus to be transferred or not, and also define the order in which components should receive focus.
