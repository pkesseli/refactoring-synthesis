Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `enable()` method in the `javax.swing.JComponent` class.

The `enable()` method is deprecated because it has been replaced by the `setEnabled()` method, which provides the same functionality. So, to refactor the code that uses the `enable()` method, you can simply replace it with the `setEnabled()` method.

Here's an example:

Before refactoring:

```
JButton button = new JButton("Click me!");
button.enable(); // deprecated method
```

After refactoring:

```
JButton button = new JButton("Click me!");
button.setEnabled(true);
```

In the refactored code, the `setEnabled()` method is used instead of the deprecated `enable()` method. The `setEnabled()` method takes a boolean value as its parameter, where `true` means that the component should be enabled, and `false` means that it should be disabled.

Note that if the component is already enabled, calling `setEnabled(true)` has no effect, and if it is already disabled, calling `setEnabled(false)` also has no effect.
