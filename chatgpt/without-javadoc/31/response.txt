Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor the deprecated `java.awt.Component.mouseDown(Event, int, int)` method:

Original code using deprecated method:

```
public class MyComponent extends Component {

    public void mouseDown(Event e, int x, int y) {
        // do something
    }
}
```

Refactored code using `java.awt.event.MouseAdapter`:

```
import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;

public class MyComponent extends Component {

    public MyComponent() {
        addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
            public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
                int x = e.getX();
                int y = e.getY();
                // do something
            }
        });
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `mouseDown` method with an implementation that uses the `java.awt.event.MouseAdapter` class. The `addMouseListener` method is used to register an anonymous inner class that extends `MouseAdapter`. This class overrides the `mousePressed` method, which is called when the mouse button is pressed. Inside the `mousePressed` method, we can get the current mouse coordinates using the `getX` and `getY` methods of the `MouseEvent` object, and then perform whatever action we want to do. 

This refactored code achieves the same functionality as the original code but uses the recommended non-deprecated methods.
