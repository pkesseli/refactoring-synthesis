Certainly! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses `getNextFocusableComponent()` to use the recommended replacement method:

Before refactoring:

```java
JButton button1 = new JButton("Button 1");
JButton button2 = new JButton("Button 2");
button1.setNextFocusableComponent(button2);
```

After refactoring:

```java
JButton button1 = new JButton("Button 1");
JButton button2 = new JButton("Button 2");
button1.setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider(true);
button1.setFocusTraversalPolicy(new FocusTraversalPolicy() {
    @Override
    public Component getComponentAfter(Container focusCycleRoot, Component aComponent) {
        if (aComponent.equals(button1)) {
            return button2;
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    // ...implement other FocusTraversalPolicy methods as necessary...
});
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `setNextFocusableComponent()` method with a custom `FocusTraversalPolicy`. The `setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider(true)` method tells Swing to use this custom policy for determining the order in which components receive focus.

The `getComponentAfter()` method of the `FocusTraversalPolicy` is responsible for determining which component should receive focus after the current component. In our example, we've hardcoded the logic to move from `button1` to `button2`, but you can customize this logic as needed to fit your specific use case.

Note that there are several other methods that you may need to implement in your `FocusTraversalPolicy` depending on your use case. The JavaDoc for `FocusTraversalPolicy` provides more information on these methods.
