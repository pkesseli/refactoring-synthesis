Sure, here's an example of refactoring the use of `javax.swing.JComponent.hide()` method, which is deprecated, to use a recommended alternative:

```
// Before refactoring
JComponent component = new JPanel();
component.hide(); // deprecated method

// After refactoring
JComponent component = new JPanel();
component.setVisible(false); // recommended alternative
```

In this refactoring example, we simply replaced the `hide()` method with the `setVisible(false)` method. The `setVisible(false)` method does the same thing as `hide()` by hiding the component, but it is not deprecated and is the recommended alternative.

Note that the `setVisible(false)` method is not an exact replacement for `hide()` in all cases. The main difference is that `setVisible(false)` also affects the layout of the container that the component belongs to, whereas `hide()` does not. Therefore, if the layout of the container is important, you may need to adjust it after calling `setVisible(false)`.

Overall, when refactoring deprecated methods, it is important to check the documentation for the recommended alternatives and to ensure that the replacement code works correctly in your specific use case.
