Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses `javax.swing.JComponent.isManagingFocus()` to use a recommended alternative:

Before refactoring:

```java
JTextField textField = new JTextField();
if (textField.isManagingFocus()) {
    // Do something
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
JTextField textField = new JTextField();
if (textField.getFocusTraversalPolicy().getDefaultComponent(textField.getParent()) == textField) {
    // Do something
}
```

Explanation:

The `isManagingFocus()` method was deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 16, and the recommended alternative is to use the `getFocusTraversalPolicy()` method. In the refactored code, we use the `getDefaultComponent(Container)` method of the `FocusTraversalPolicy` class to determine whether the text field is the default focus traversal component for its parent container. This achieves the same result as the original code that checked whether the component is managing focus.
