Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `javax.swing.JComponent.requestDefaultFocus()`:

Before refactoring:

```java
JTextField textField = new JTextField();
textField.requestDefaultFocus();
```

After refactoring:

```java
JTextField textField = new JTextField();
textField.requestFocusInWindow();
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated method `requestDefaultFocus()` with the recommended method `requestFocusInWindow()`. This method is preferred over the deprecated method because it provides better cross-platform compatibility and is more reliable in different environments.
