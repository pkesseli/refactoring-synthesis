Sure, I can provide an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.JComponent.reshape(int, int, int, int)` method.

Deprecated methods are no longer recommended to use because they may be removed in future versions, so it's better to replace them with newer methods. In this case, the `setBounds(int, int, int, int)` method can be used instead of `reshape(int, int, int, int)`.

Here's an example code snippet that uses `reshape(int, int, int, int)`:

```java
JButton button = new JButton("Click me");
button.reshape(50, 50, 100, 30);
```

To refactor this code, we can replace the `reshape(int, int, int, int)` method with the `setBounds(int, int, int, int)` method. The `setBounds` method sets the size and position of the component, which is exactly what we want to do with the `reshape` method. Here's the refactored code:

```java
JButton button = new JButton("Click me");
button.setBounds(50, 50, 100, 30);
```

As you can see, the only difference is that we're using the `setBounds` method instead of `reshape`. This is a small change, but it's important to keep our code up-to-date with the latest best practices.
