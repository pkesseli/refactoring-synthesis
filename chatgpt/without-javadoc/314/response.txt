Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated method `javax.swing.JComponent.reshapeâ€‹(int, int, int, int)` to use the recommended alternative method:

Before refactoring:

```
JButton button = new JButton("Click me");
button.reshape(50, 50, 100, 30);
```

After refactoring:

```
JButton button = new JButton("Click me");
button.setBounds(50, 50, 100, 30);
```

The `setBounds(int x, int y, int width, int height)` method is the recommended alternative to `reshape(int x, int y, int width, int height)`. It is also part of the `java.awt.Component` class, which is a superclass of `javax.swing.JComponent`. The `setBounds` method allows you to set the size and position of the component in one method call.

By using `setBounds`, you can achieve the same result as `reshape`, but with a more up-to-date and reliable method.
