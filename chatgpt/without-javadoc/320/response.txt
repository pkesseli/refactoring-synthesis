Sure! The `getText()` method of the `javax.swing.JPasswordField` class has been deprecated because it returns the password as a `String`, which can be a security risk in certain situations. Instead, the recommended approach is to use the `getPassword()` method, which returns the password as an array of `char`.

Here's an example of how you could refactor your code to use `getPassword()` instead of `getText()`:

Before:

```
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
String password = passwordField.getText();
```

After:

```
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
char[] passwordChars = passwordField.getPassword();
String password = new String(passwordChars);
```

Note that the `getPassword()` method returns an array of `char`, not a `String`, so you need to convert it to a `String` if you need to use it as such.

Also, keep in mind that using a `char[]` to represent a password is more secure than using a `String`, because `String` objects are immutable and can be inadvertently leaked or logged. In contrast, a `char[]` can be cleared from memory once it's no longer needed, reducing the risk of it being compromised.
