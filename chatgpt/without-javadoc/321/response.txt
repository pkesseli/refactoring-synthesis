Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.JPasswordField.getText(int, int)` method:

```java
// Old code that uses deprecated method
JPasswordField passwordField = new JPasswordField();
String password = passwordField.getText(0, passwordField.getPassword().length);

// Refactored code that uses the recommended method
char[] passwordChars = passwordField.getPassword();
String password = new String(passwordChars);
```

In the refactored code, we first get the password characters using the `getPassword()` method, which returns a `char[]` array. We then create a new `String` object from the `char[]` array, which gives us the password in string format.

Note that storing passwords in plain text is generally not recommended. Instead, you should consider using a password manager or storing passwords securely using techniques such as hashing and salting.
