Sure! 

Instead of using the deprecated method `getComponentAtIndex(int)`, you can refactor your code to use the `getComponent(int)` method of the `javax.swing.JPopupMenu` class. 

Here's an example:

```
// Deprecated method
Component component = popupMenu.getComponentAtIndex(index);

// Refactored code
Component component = popupMenu.getComponent(index);
```

In the refactored code, we are using the non-deprecated `getComponent(int)` method instead of the deprecated `getComponentAtIndex(int)` method. This change will ensure that our code continues to work correctly even if the deprecated method is removed in future versions of Java.
