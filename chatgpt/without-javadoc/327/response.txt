Certainly, here's an example of how to refactor the use of the `isBackingStoreEnabled()` method in `javax.swing.JViewport`:

Before refactoring:
```java
JViewport viewport = new JViewport();
boolean isBackingStoreEnabled = viewport.isBackingStoreEnabled();
System.out.println("Is backing store enabled: " + isBackingStoreEnabled);
```

After refactoring:
```java
JViewport viewport = new JViewport();
boolean isBackingStoreSupported = viewport.isBackingStoreSupported();
System.out.println("Is backing store supported: " + isBackingStoreSupported);
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated method `isBackingStoreEnabled()` with the recommended alternative, `isBackingStoreSupported()`. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the viewport supports a backing store, which is used to improve performance in some cases.

It's worth noting that if the original code was explicitly setting the backing store enabled or disabled, the refactored code may need to include additional logic to set the backing store based on the return value of `isBackingStoreSupported()`.
