Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `setBackingStoreEnabled` method:

```
// Old code using the deprecated method
JViewport viewport = new JViewport();
viewport.setBackingStoreEnabled(false);

// Refactored code using an alternative method
JViewport viewport = new JViewport();
viewport.setScrollMode(JViewport.SIMPLE_SCROLL_MODE);
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated method `setBackingStoreEnabled` with the alternative method `setScrollMode`, which is not deprecated. The `SIMPLE_SCROLL_MODE` option provides similar functionality to the old method - it disables double buffering, which can improve performance in some cases.

Note that this is just one possible refactoring - depending on your specific use case, there may be other methods or techniques you can use to achieve the desired result without relying on the deprecated method.
