Sure! Here's an example refactoring of the deprecated `java.awt.Component.mouseEnter(Event, int, int)` method.

The `mouseEnter(Event, int, int)` method was deprecated in Java 1.1 and replaced with the `java.awt.event.MouseListener.mouseEntered(MouseEvent)` method. To refactor your code to use this new method, you can follow these steps:

1. First, remove the deprecated `mouseEnter(Event, int, int)` method from your code.

2. Implement the `java.awt.event.MouseListener` interface in your class.

3. Override the `mouseEntered(MouseEvent e)` method in your class.

4. Inside the `mouseEntered(MouseEvent e)` method, add your logic to handle when the mouse enters the component.

Here's an example of what your code might look like after the refactoring:

```
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;
import java.awt.event.MouseListener;

public class MyComponent implements MouseListener {
    
    // Constructor and other methods
    
    @Override
    public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {
        int x = e.getX();
        int y = e.getY();
        
        // Your logic to handle when the mouse enters the component
    }
    
    // Other methods from MouseListener interface
}
```

By implementing the `MouseListener` interface and overriding the `mouseEntered(MouseEvent e)` method, you can handle mouse enter events in a way that is both up-to-date and compatible with newer versions of Java.
