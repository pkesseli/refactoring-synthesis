Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses `createKeyboardDownRightListener()` method, which is deprecated in `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneUI`.

Before refactoring, the code might look something like this:

```
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = (BasicSplitPaneUI) mySplitPane.getUI();
Action downRightListener = splitPaneUI.createKeyboardDownRightListener();
```

To refactor this code, we need to replace the deprecated method with an alternative that achieves the same functionality. In this case, we can use the `createDownRightArrowAction()` method instead.

Here's the refactored code:

```
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = (BasicSplitPaneUI) mySplitPane.getUI();
Action downRightListener = splitPaneUI.createDownRightArrowAction();
```

This should achieve the same functionality as the original code, but without using the deprecated method.
