Sure! Here's an example refactoring that replaces the deprecated `createKeyboardResizeToggleListener()` method in `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneUI`:

```java
// Old code using deprecated method
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.createKeyboardResizeToggleListener();

// Refactored code
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.getHandler().installKeyboardActions();
```

In the refactored code, we're using the `getHandler()` method instead of the deprecated `createKeyboardResizeToggleListener()` method. The `getHandler()` method returns an instance of `BasicSplitPaneUI.KeyboardEndHandler`, which provides a replacement implementation for the keyboard resize toggle behavior. We then call `installKeyboardActions()` on the `KeyboardEndHandler` instance to install the updated keyboard actions.

Note that the `installKeyboardActions()` method was introduced in Java 6, so make sure you're using a version of Java that supports it.
