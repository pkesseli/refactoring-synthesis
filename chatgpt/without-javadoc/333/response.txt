Certainly! Here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated method `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneUI.createKeyboardResizeToggleListener()`:

```java
// Original code using deprecated method
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.createKeyboardResizeToggleListener();

// Refactored code
BasicSplitPaneUI splitPaneUI = new BasicSplitPaneUI();
splitPaneUI.getHandler().installKeyboardActions(); // new method to replace deprecated one
```

In the refactored code, we're using the `installKeyboardActions()` method on the `Handler` object returned by the `getHandler()` method. This method is a replacement for the deprecated `createKeyboardResizeToggleListener()` method and will set up the keyboard actions for the split pane.

Note that this refactored code assumes that you've already created and set up your `JSplitPane` object with the `BasicSplitPaneUI`.
