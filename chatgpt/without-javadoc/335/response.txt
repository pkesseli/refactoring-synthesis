Sure, here's an example of refactoring the `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneUI.getDividerBorderSize()` method, which is deprecated:

Before:

```java
public int getDividerBorderSize() {
  return dividerBorderSize;
}
```

After:

```java
public int getDividerBorderSize() {
  Border border = splitPane.getDividerBorder();
  return (border != null) ? border.getBorderInsets(splitPane).left : 0;
}
```

Explanation:

The `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicSplitPaneUI.getDividerBorderSize()` method returns the size of the border around the divider in a `JSplitPane`. This method is deprecated because the border around the divider is now controlled by the `setDividerSize()` method. 

To refactor this method, we can use the `getDividerBorder()` method to retrieve the border around the divider. If the border is not `null`, we can use its `getBorderInsets()` method to retrieve the size of the left inset, which corresponds to the size of the border around the divider. Otherwise, we return 0, indicating that there is no border around the divider. This refactored method should give the same result as the deprecated method, but is more up-to-date and should be more future-proof.
