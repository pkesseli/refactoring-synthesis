Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `viewToModel` method in `javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTextUI`.

Before:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();
Point point = new Point(50, 100);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int caretPosition = ((BasicTextUI) textComponent.getUI()).viewToModel(textComponent, point, bias);
```

After:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();
Point point = new Point(50, 100);
int caretPosition = textComponent.viewToModel(point);
```

In the refactored code, we're using the `viewToModel` method directly on the `JTextComponent` instance, rather than casting it to `BasicTextUI` and calling the deprecated method. The `Position.Bias[]` parameter is not used in the original code, so we can remove it as well.

Note that if you're using a version of Java that supports the `getTextOffset` method on `TextUI`, you could use that instead of `viewToModel`. Here's an example of what that would look like:

```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();
Point point = new Point(50, 100);
int offset = ((BasicTextUI) textComponent.getUI()).getTextOffset(textComponent, point);
```

In this case, we're calling the `getTextOffset` method on `BasicTextUI`, which is the recommended replacement for `viewToModel`. However, `getTextOffset` is only available in Java 9 and later, so if you're using an earlier version of Java, you'll need to use `viewToModel` or the refactored code that uses `JTextComponent.viewToModel`.
