Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `java.awt.Component.mouseExit(Event, int, int)` method:

Original code:

```
public class MyComponent extends Component {

    public void mouseExited(Event e, int x, int y) {
        // do something
    }
    
}
```

Refactored code:

```
public class MyComponent extends Component {
    
    public MyComponent() {
        addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {
                onMouseExited(e);
            }
        });
    }
    
    public void onMouseExited(MouseEvent e) {
        // do something
    }
    
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the `mouseExited(Event, int, int)` method with a new method `onMouseExited(MouseEvent)` which will be called when the mouse exits the component. Instead of overriding the deprecated `mouseExit(Event, int, int)` method, we add a `MouseListener` to the component in the constructor and implement its `mouseExited(MouseEvent)` method to call our new `onMouseExited(MouseEvent)` method. This way, we can handle the mouse exit event in a modern, non-deprecated way.
