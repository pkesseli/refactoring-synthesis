Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `editablePropertyChanged()` method in `javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalComboBoxUI`:

Before refactoring:

```
import javax.swing.JComboBox;
import javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalComboBoxUI;

public class ComboBoxExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JComboBox<String> comboBox = new JComboBox<>(new String[]{"Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"});
        MetalComboBoxUI ui = new MetalComboBoxUI();
        ui.editablePropertyChanged(null);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import javax.swing.JComboBox;
import javax.swing.UIManager;

public class ComboBoxExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JComboBox<String> comboBox = new JComboBox<>(new String[]{"Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"});
        UIManager.getLookAndFeel().getDefaults().put("ComboBox.noActionOnKeyNavigation", true);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

In the refactored code, we're setting the `"ComboBox.noActionOnKeyNavigation"` property to `true` using the `UIManager` class. This property was introduced as a replacement for the `editablePropertyChanged()` method that was deprecated in Java 9.

The `"ComboBox.noActionOnKeyNavigation"` property indicates whether the combo box should enter edit mode when a user types a key. By setting it to `true`, we're disabling this behavior and ensuring that the combo box doesn't enter edit mode.

Note that you can also use the `JComboBox.setEditable(false)` method to disable editing of the combo box. However, this won't disable the behavior where the combo box enters edit mode when a user types a key, so it's not a direct replacement for the deprecated method.
