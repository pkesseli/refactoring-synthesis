Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `javax.swing.plaf.multi.MultiTextUI.modelToViewâ€‹(JTextComponent, int)` method. 

Firstly, let's understand what this method does. It is used to convert a model coordinate (index of a character in the text) to a view coordinate (x,y position in the UI) in a `JTextComponent`. This method is part of the `MultiTextUI` class which is a UI delegate for `JTextComponent` and is used to provide platform-specific look and feel for text components.

As this method is deprecated, it is recommended to use an alternative method to achieve the same functionality. In this case, the recommended method is `javax.swing.text.View.modelToView(int, Shape, Position.Bias)`.

Here's an example of how to refactor your code to use the recommended method:

```
// Old code using deprecated method
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
int modelIndex = 10;
Rectangle rect = textComponent.getUI().modelToView(textComponent, modelIndex);

// Refactored code using the recommended method
int viewIndex = textComponent.getDocument().getDefaultRootElement().getElementIndex(modelIndex);
Shape shape = textComponent.getUI().modelToView(textComponent, viewIndex, Position.Bias.Forward);
Rectangle rect = (shape instanceof Rectangle) ? (Rectangle)shape : shape.getBounds();
```

In the refactored code, we first get the view index (instead of model index) of the character using `getElementIndex()` method. Then, we pass this view index along with the `Position.Bias.Forward` parameter to the recommended `modelToView()` method. This method returns a `Shape` object which represents the visual position of the character in the UI. Finally, we convert this `Shape` object to a `Rectangle` object and use it as required.
