Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `modelToView` method using the recommended replacement method `modelToView2D`.

Before refactoring:

```java
import javax.swing.text.Position;

public class TextUIRefactoringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
        int pos = 5;
        Position.Bias bias = Position.Bias.Forward;
        
        MultiTextUI multiTextUI = new MultiTextUI();
        Rectangle rect = multiTextUI.modelToView(textComponent, pos, bias);
        
        // Do something with rect
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import javax.swing.text.Position;

public class TextUIRefactoringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
        int pos = 5;
        Position.Bias bias = Position.Bias.Forward;
        
        MultiTextUI multiTextUI = new MultiTextUI();
        Shape shape = multiTextUI.modelToView2D(textComponent, pos, bias);
        Rectangle rect = (shape instanceof Rectangle) ? (Rectangle)shape : shape.getBounds();
        
        // Do something with rect
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated `modelToView` method with the `modelToView2D` method. However, the return type of `modelToView2D` is `Shape`, not `Rectangle` as in the original method. Therefore, we must first check if the returned shape is an instance of `Rectangle`, and if it is not, we can get the bounds of the shape to obtain a `Rectangle` object. This way, we can continue using the `Rectangle` object as we did before.
