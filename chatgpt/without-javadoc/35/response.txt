Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.mouseMove(Event, int, int)` method.

Before:

```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Event;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Component component = new Component() {
            @Override
            public boolean mouseMove(Event evt, int x, int y) {
                System.out.println("Mouse moved to x=" + x + ", y=" + y);
                return true;
            }
        };

        Event event = new Event(component, Event.MOUSE_MOVE, null);
        component.mouseMove(event, 100, 200);
    }
}
```

After:

```
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.MouseInfo;
import java.awt.Point;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Component component = new Component() {
            @Override
            public void setLocation(int x, int y) {
                super.setLocation(x, y);
                System.out.println("Mouse moved to x=" + x + ", y=" + y);
            }
        };
        
        Point mouseLocation = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation();
        component.setLocation(mouseLocation.x + 100, mouseLocation.y + 200);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the use of the deprecated `mouseMove(Event, int, int)` method with a new implementation of `setLocation(int, int)` method of the `Component` class. This method is used to set the location of the component on the screen, so we've overridden it to print a message to the console indicating the new mouse position.

To get the current mouse position, we've used the `MouseInfo.getPointerInfo()` method, which returns a `PointerInfo` object representing the current position of the mouse. We've then used the `getLocation()` method of this object to get a `Point` object representing the mouse position, and added 100 to the x-coordinate and 200 to the y-coordinate to simulate a mouse movement.

Note that this is just one example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `mouseMove(Event, int, int)` method. The specific refactoring required will depend on the context in which the method is being used.
