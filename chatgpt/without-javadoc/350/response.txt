Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the `javax.swing.plaf.TextUI.viewToModelâ€‹(JTextComponent, Point)` method, which is deprecated:

Before Refactoring:
```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point point = new Point(10, 10);
TextUI textUI = textComponent.getUI();
int index = textUI.viewToModel(textComponent, point);
```

After Refactoring:
```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextComponent();
Point point = new Point(10, 10);
int index = textComponent.viewToModel(point);
```

In the refactored code, we no longer need to get the `TextUI` instance and call the `viewToModel` method on it. Instead, we can directly call the `viewToModel` method on the `JTextComponent` instance itself. This is because the `viewToModel` method has been moved from `TextUI` to `JTextComponent` in Java 9. So, by calling the method on the `JTextComponent` instance, we avoid using the deprecated method and use the updated one.
