Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor the use of `javax.swing.RepaintManager.addDirtyRegionâ€‹(Applet, int, int, int, int)` method, which is deprecated:

Before:

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.applet.Applet;

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
    
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        
        // Drawing code here
        
        RepaintManager rm = RepaintManager.currentManager(this);
        rm.addDirtyRegion((Applet)this.getParent(), getX(), getY(), getWidth(), getHeight());
    }
}
```

After:

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.Rectangle;

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        
        // Drawing code here
        
        Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(getX(), getY(), getWidth(), getHeight());
        RepaintManager rm = RepaintManager.currentManager(this);
        rm.addDirtyRegion(this, bounds.x, bounds.y, bounds.width, bounds.height);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the use of `Applet` as the first argument with `this` because it is the same as the `JPanel` itself. Instead of passing separate arguments for the X, Y, width, and height values, we have created a `Rectangle` object that represents the bounds of the `JPanel`. Finally, we have updated the call to `addDirtyRegion()` to pass the `Rectangle` bounds as separate arguments.
