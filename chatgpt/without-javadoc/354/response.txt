Sure! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.SwingUtilities.findFocusOwner(Component)` method to use the recommended alternative:

Before refactoring:

```
Component focusOwner = SwingUtilities.findFocusOwner(parent);
if (focusOwner != null) {
   // Do something with the focus owner
}
```

After refactoring:

```
Window windowAncestor = SwingUtilities.getWindowAncestor(parent);
if (windowAncestor != null) {
   FocusOwner focusOwner = windowAncestor.getFocusOwner();
   if (focusOwner != null) {
      // Do something with the focus owner
   }
}
```

In the refactored code, we use `SwingUtilities.getWindowAncestor(Component)` to get the top-level `Window` ancestor of the `parent` component. Then we use the `getFocusOwner()` method of `Window` to get the component that currently has the focus. This is the recommended alternative to the deprecated `SwingUtilities.findFocusOwner(Component)` method.
