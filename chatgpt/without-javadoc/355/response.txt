Sure! The `javax.swing.table.TableColumn.disableResizedPosting()` method is deprecated, and you should use a different approach to disable resizing posting. Here's an example of how to refactor your code:

Before refactoring:

```java
TableColumn column = table.getColumnModel().getColumn(index);
column.disableResizedPosting();
```

After refactoring:

```java
TableColumn column = table.getColumnModel().getColumn(index);
column.setResizingAllowed(false);
```

In the refactored code, we use the `setResizingAllowed(false)` method to disable column resizing posting. This method has the same effect as the deprecated `disableResizedPosting()` method but is not deprecated and is recommended for use instead.

You can also set this property when creating the `TableColumn` instance, like this:

```java
TableColumn column = new TableColumn(index);
column.setResizable(false);
```

In this case, we use the `setResizable(false)` method to disable resizing for the column at the time of creation. This approach can be useful if you know ahead of time that the column should not be resizable.

Remember that the exact refactoring approach you choose may depend on your specific use case and requirements.
