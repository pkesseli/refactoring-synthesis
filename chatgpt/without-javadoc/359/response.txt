Sure, here is an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.text.JTextComponent.viewToModelâ€‹(Point)` method:

Before Refactoring:
```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();
Point point = new Point(50, 50);
int offset = textComponent.viewToModel(point);
```

After Refactoring:
```java
JTextComponent textComponent = new JTextArea();
Point point = new Point(50, 50);
int offset = getTextOffsetAtPoint(textComponent, point);
```

And here's the implementation of the new `getTextOffsetAtPoint` method:

```java
public static int getTextOffsetAtPoint(JTextComponent textComponent, Point point) {
    int viewToModelOffset = -1;
    Point adjustedPoint = new Point(point);
    int insetsTop = textComponent.getInsets().top;
    int insetsLeft = textComponent.getInsets().left;
    adjustedPoint.translate(-insetsLeft, -insetsTop);
    View rootView = textComponent.getUI().getRootView(textComponent);
    if (rootView != null) {
        rootView.setSize(textComponent.getSize());
        viewToModelOffset = rootView.viewToModel(adjustedPoint);
    }
    return viewToModelOffset;
}
```

This new method first adjusts the point to account for any insets on the text component, then gets the root view of the text component's UI and sets its size to match the text component's size. Finally, it calls the `viewToModel` method on the root view to get the offset of the text at the specified point. 

By refactoring the code in this way, we are no longer using the deprecated method and have created a reusable method that can be called whenever we need to get the offset of text at a given point in a text component.
