Sure! The `drawEchoCharacter` method in `javax.swing.text.PasswordView` is deprecated because it uses a deprecated `Graphics` method (`drawBytes`). Here's an example of how to refactor the method to use the recommended `drawChars` method instead:

Before refactoring:

```java
public void drawEchoCharacter(Graphics g, int x, int y, char c) {
    byte[] bytes = { (byte) c };
    g.drawBytes(bytes, 0, 1, x, y);
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
public void drawEchoCharacter(Graphics g, int x, int y, char c) {
    char[] chars = { c };
    g.drawChars(chars, 0, 1, x, y);
}
```

In the refactored code, we use `drawChars` instead of `drawBytes`. This method takes a `char` array instead of a `byte` array, so we create a new `char` array with the single character we want to draw. We then pass this array to `drawChars` along with the `x` and `y` coordinates where we want to draw the character. This version of the method will work without any deprecated code.
