Sure! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.swing.text.PasswordView.drawUnselectedText` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
public class MyPasswordView extends PasswordView {

  @Override
  protected int drawUnselectedText(Graphics g, int x, int y, int p0, int p1)
  {
    // Draw unselected text using the deprecated method
    return super.drawUnselectedText(g, x, y, p0, p1);
  }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
public class MyPasswordView extends PasswordView {

  @Override
  protected void paintUnselectedText(Graphics g, int x, int y, int p0, int p1)
  {
    // Draw unselected text using the recommended replacement method
    super.paintUnselectedText(g, x, y, p0, p1);
  }
}
```

As you can see, the recommended replacement method for `drawUnselectedText` is `paintUnselectedText`. This new method is used in the refactored code instead of the deprecated method.

Note that the return type of the methods is different - `drawUnselectedText` returns an `int`, while `paintUnselectedText` returns `void`. If you need to return a value from the method, you'll need to find a different way to do so, such as by setting a variable in the class or using a callback function.
