Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the `move(int, int)` method of the `java.awt.Component` class:

Original Code:

```java
import java.awt.Component;

public class Example {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Component comp = new Component();
    comp.move(100, 200);
  }
}
```

Refactored Code:

```java
import java.awt.Component;

public class Example {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Component comp = new Component();
    comp.setLocation(100, 200);
  }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the `move(int, int)` method with the `setLocation(int, int)` method. The `setLocation(int, int)` method sets the component's new location, and the component will be redrawn at the new location on the next repaint. This method provides the same functionality as the `move(int, int)` method, but it is not deprecated.
