Sure, here's an example refactoring using the recommended alternative method for `javax.swing.text.View.modelToView(int, Shape)`:

Before:

```java
View view = textComponent.getUI().getRootView(textComponent).getView(0);
Shape shape = view.modelToView(0);
```

After:

```java
View view = textComponent.getUI().getRootView(textComponent).getView(0);
Rectangle rect = view.modelToView2D(0).getBounds();
Shape shape = new Rectangle2D.Double(rect.getX(), rect.getY(), rect.getWidth(), rect.getHeight());
```

In this example, the deprecated `modelToView(int, Shape)` method has been replaced with the recommended alternative `modelToView2D(int).getBounds()` method. This method returns a `Rectangle2D` object which can be converted to a `Shape` object using its `getBounds()` method. The code then constructs a new `Rectangle2D` object from the bounds of the original `Rectangle2D`, which can be used as the new `Shape` object.

Note that this is just one possible way to refactor the code, and the specific refactoring will depend on the context and requirements of the application.
