Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated method `javax.swing.text.View.viewToModel​(float, float, Shape)`.

The deprecated method `javax.swing.text.View.viewToModel​(float, float, Shape)` is used to convert a point in a view's coordinate system to the closest position in the associated document. The method is deprecated because it does not handle bidi (bidirectional) text correctly. The replacement method, `javax.swing.text.View.viewToModel(Point2D, Position.Bias[])`, handles bidi text correctly.

Here is an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method:

Before refactoring:

```java
float x = 10.0f;
float y = 20.0f;
Shape shape = new Rectangle2D.Float(0, 0, 100, 100);
int offset = view.viewToModel(x, y, shape);
```

After refactoring:

```java
float x = 10.0f;
float y = 20.0f;
Point2D point = new Point2D.Float(x, y);
Position.Bias[] bias = new Position.Bias[1];
int offset = view.viewToModel(point, bias);
```

As you can see, the new code creates a `Point2D` object with the x and y coordinates, and passes it to the replacement method `viewToModel(Point2D, Position.Bias[])`. The method also requires a `Position.Bias[]` array, which is used to return the bias of the position (either `Position.Bias.Forward` or `Position.Bias.Backward`). In this example, we create a new `Position.Bias[]` array with one element.

Note that the replacement method returns a `Position` object, not an offset as the deprecated method did. You can get the offset from the `Position` object using the `getOffset()` method:

```java
int offset = view.viewToModel(point, bias).getOffset();
```
