Sure, here is an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `nextFocus()` method in Java AWT:

Let's say you have a `JPanel` called `myPanel` that contains several components, and you want to set the focus to the next component in the panel when a certain action is triggered. Instead of using the deprecated `nextFocus()` method, you can use the `KeyboardFocusManager` class to achieve the same result.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use `KeyboardFocusManager` to set the focus to the next component in `myPanel`:

```
// Get the current focus manager
KeyboardFocusManager focusManager = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager();

// Get the current focus component
Component currentFocus = focusManager.getFocusOwner();

// Get all the components in myPanel
Component[] components = myPanel.getComponents();

// Find the index of the current focus component in the array of components
int currentIndex = -1;
for (int i = 0; i < components.length; i++) {
    if (components[i] == currentFocus) {
        currentIndex = i;
        break;
    }
}

// Set the focus to the next component in the array, wrapping around to the first component if necessary
int nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % components.length;
Component nextComponent = components[nextIndex];
nextComponent.requestFocusInWindow();
```

In this refactored code, we use the `KeyboardFocusManager` class to get the current focus owner, get all the components in `myPanel`, find the index of the current focus component in the array of components, and then set the focus to the next component in the array using the `requestFocusInWindow()` method. This achieves the same result as the deprecated `nextFocus()` method, but using modern, non-deprecated code.
