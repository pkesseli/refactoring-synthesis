Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor the use of `DefaultTreeSelectionModel.notifyPathChange(Vector<?>, TreePath)` to use the recommended method instead:

Deprecated method usage:

```java
DefaultTreeSelectionModel selectionModel = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel();
Vector<TreePath> paths = new Vector<>();
paths.add(new TreePath(new Object[] {"parent", "child"}));
selectionModel.notifyPathChange(paths, null);
```

Refactored usage:

```java
DefaultTreeSelectionModel selectionModel = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel();
TreePath[] paths = {new TreePath(new Object[] {"parent", "child"})};
TreeSelectionEvent event = new TreeSelectionEvent(selectionModel, paths, null, null);
selectionModel.notifyListeners(event);
```

In the refactored code, we create a `TreeSelectionEvent` object with the selected paths and the selection model, and then call `notifyListeners()` on the selection model to trigger the event. This is the recommended way to update the selection in Swing since Java 7.
