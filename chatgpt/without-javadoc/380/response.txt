Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the `notifyPathChange(Vector<?>, TreePath)` method, which is deprecated in the `javax.swing.tree.DefaultTreeSelectionModel` class:

Before refactoring:

```java
DefaultTreeSelectionModel selectionModel = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel();
Vector<TreePath> paths = new Vector<>();
TreePath path = new TreePath(rootNode);
paths.add(path);

// Deprecated method call
selectionModel.notifyPathChange(paths, path);
```

After refactoring:

```java
DefaultTreeSelectionModel selectionModel = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel();
TreePath path = new TreePath(rootNode);
selectionModel.setSelectionPath(path);
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the use of the `notifyPathChange()` method with the `setSelectionPath()` method, which sets the selection path of the `DefaultTreeSelectionModel` directly. This is a simpler and more straightforward way to achieve the same result.

Note that if you need to select multiple paths, you can use the `setSelectionPaths()` method instead:

```java
DefaultTreeSelectionModel selectionModel = new DefaultTreeSelectionModel();
TreePath[] paths = new TreePath[] {
  new TreePath(rootNode.getChild(0)),
  new TreePath(rootNode.getChild(1)),
  new TreePath(rootNode.getChild(2))
};
selectionModel.setSelectionPaths(paths);
``` 

This refactoring example should help you update your code to remove the use of the deprecated `notifyPathChange()` method.
