Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the use of the deprecated `javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory.newInstance(String, ClassLoader)` method:

Before refactoring:
```
XMLEventFactory eventFactory = XMLEventFactory.newInstance("javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory", null);
```

After refactoring:
```
XMLEventFactory eventFactory = XMLEventFactory.newFactory();
```

Explanation:

The `javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory.newFactory()` method was introduced in Java 6 as a replacement for the deprecated `newInstance(String, ClassLoader)` method. It creates a new instance of `XMLEventFactory` using the default implementation class name and class loader. Here are the steps to refactor the code:

1. Replace the deprecated method call with the `newFactory()` method call.
2. Remove the first argument `"javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory"` since it's the default implementation class name and no longer necessary.
3. Remove the second argument `null` since it's the default class loader and no longer necessary.

The refactored code should work exactly the same as the original code, but without using any deprecated methods.
