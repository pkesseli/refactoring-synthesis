Certainly! Here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory.newInstance(String, ClassLoader)` method:

Before refactoring:
```java
XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance("com.sun.xml.internal.stream.XMLInputFactoryImpl", this.getClass().getClassLoader());
```

After refactoring:
```java
XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newFactory("com.sun.xml.internal.stream.XMLInputFactoryImpl", this.getClass().getClassLoader());
```

Explanation:
Instead of using the deprecated `newInstance` method, we can use the `newFactory` method provided by `XMLInputFactory` to create a new instance of the factory. The `newFactory` method takes the same two arguments as the deprecated `newInstance` method: a `String` specifying the fully-qualified name of the factory implementation class, and a `ClassLoader` to use for loading the class.
