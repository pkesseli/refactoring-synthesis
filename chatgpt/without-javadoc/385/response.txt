Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the use of `javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory.newInstance(String, ClassLoader)` to use the recommended method instead:

Deprecated method:
```java
XMLOutputFactory xmlOutputFactory = XMLOutputFactory.newInstance("javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory", getClass().getClassLoader());
```

Refactored method:
```java
XMLOutputFactory xmlOutputFactory = XMLOutputFactory.newFactory();
```

In the refactored method, we're using the `newFactory()` method provided by `XMLOutputFactory` class, which returns a new instance of `XMLOutputFactory` using the default factory implementation class. This is the recommended approach since the deprecated method might be removed in future versions of the API.
