Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Component.preferredSize()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    
    @Override
    public Dimension preferredSize() {
        return new Dimension(100, 100);
    }
    
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Component;
import java.awt.Dimension;

public class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    
    @Override
    public Dimension getPreferredSize() {
        return new Dimension(100, 100);
    }
    
}
```

In the refactored code, we have changed the method `preferredSize()` to `getPreferredSize()`, which is the recommended method to use instead of the deprecated one. The implementation of the method remains the same, returning a `Dimension` object with the preferred size of the component. 

Note that this is just a simple example, and in a real-world scenario, you may need to refactor multiple classes and methods that use the deprecated method. Also, you may want to consider using newer layout managers, such as `GridBagLayout` or `BoxLayout`, instead of relying on the preferred size of components to position them.
