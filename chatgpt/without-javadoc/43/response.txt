Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `resize()` method in `java.awt.Component`:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyComponent extends Component {
    
    // This is the old code that uses the deprecated resize() method:
    public void oldResize(Dimension dimension) {
        this.resize(dimension);
    }
    
    // Here's the refactored code that uses setPreferredSize() instead:
    public void newResize(Dimension dimension) {
        this.setPreferredSize(dimension);
        this.revalidate();
    }
    
}
```

In the refactored code, we replace the call to `resize()` with `setPreferredSize()`, which is the recommended way to resize a component in Java Swing. We also call `revalidate()` to ensure that the layout manager recalculates the layout of the component and its children.

Note that this is just one example of how you could refactor code that uses the `resize()` method. The best approach will depend on the specific use case and the rest of the codebase.
