Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `show()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Frame;

public class MyFrame extends Frame {
    public MyFrame() {
        super("My Frame");
        setSize(300, 200);
        show();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Frame;

public class MyFrame extends Frame {
    public MyFrame() {
        super("My Frame");
        setSize(300, 200);
        setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the `show()` method with `setVisible(true)`. This is because `show()` has been deprecated since Java 1.5 and should no longer be used. The `setVisible(true)` method achieves the same result of making the component visible on the screen. 

Note that if you want to hide the component, you can use `setVisible(false)` instead of `hide()`, which is also deprecated.
