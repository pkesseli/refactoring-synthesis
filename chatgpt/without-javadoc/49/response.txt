Certainly! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Container.deliverEvent(Event)` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class MyContainer extends Container {

    public void processEvent(Event event) {
        // Handle the event

        // Pass the event to any child components
        super.deliverEvent(event);
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyContainer extends Container {

    public void processEvent(Event event) {
        // Handle the event

        // Pass the event to any child components
        EventQueue queue = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemEventQueue();
        queue.postEvent(new ComponentEvent(this, event.getID(), event.getWhen(), event.getModifiers()));
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we use the `EventQueue.postEvent(AWTEvent)` method to post a new event to the system event queue. We create a new `ComponentEvent` object using information from the original event, and pass it to `postEvent()` along with a reference to the container that's processing the event.

This refactored code achieves the same result as the original code, without using the deprecated `deliverEvent()` method.
