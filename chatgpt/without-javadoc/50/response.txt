Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that.

The `insets()` method in the `java.awt.Container` class is deprecated, which means it is no longer recommended for use because there is a better alternative available. The deprecated method has been replaced by the `getInsets()` method.

To refactor your code to use the `getInsets()` method instead of the deprecated `insets()` method, you can follow these steps:

1. Locate all the places in your code where the `insets()` method is being used.
2. Replace all calls to the `insets()` method with calls to the `getInsets()` method.
3. Update any necessary import statements to ensure that the new method is being referenced correctly.

Here is an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated `insets()` method:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class ExampleFrame extends Frame {

    public ExampleFrame() {
        setSize(300, 200);
        setLocation(100, 100);
        setResizable(false);

        Panel panel = new Panel();
        panel.setBackground(Color.WHITE);

        add(panel);

        Insets insets = insets();
        int panelWidth = getWidth() - insets.left - insets.right;
        int panelHeight = getHeight() - insets.top - insets.bottom;

        panel.setBounds(insets.left, insets.top, panelWidth, panelHeight);

        setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new ExampleFrame();
    }

}
```

And here is the refactored code that uses the recommended `getInsets()` method instead:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class ExampleFrame extends Frame {

    public ExampleFrame() {
        setSize(300, 200);
        setLocation(100, 100);
        setResizable(false);

        Panel panel = new Panel();
        panel.setBackground(Color.WHITE);

        add(panel);

        Insets insets = getInsets();
        int panelWidth = getWidth() - insets.left - insets.right;
        int panelHeight = getHeight() - insets.top - insets.bottom;

        panel.setBounds(insets.left, insets.top, panelWidth, panelHeight);

        setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new ExampleFrame();
    }

}
```

As you can see, the only change required was to replace `insets()` with `getInsets()`.
