Sure, I can show you an example of refactoring the use of the `java.awt.Container.layout()` method.

The `java.awt.Container.layout()` method is used to set the layout manager for a container. However, this method is deprecated, which means that it is no longer recommended to use it. Instead, it is recommended to use the `java.awt.Container.setLayout(LayoutManager mgr)` method.

Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use the `setLayout()` method instead of the deprecated `layout()` method:

Before Refactoring:

```java
JPanel myPanel = new JPanel();
myPanel.layout(new GridLayout(2, 2));
```

After Refactoring:

```java
JPanel myPanel = new JPanel();
myPanel.setLayout(new GridLayout(2, 2));
```

In this refactoring example, we have simply replaced the deprecated `layout()` method with the `setLayout()` method. Now, the code uses the recommended way to set the layout manager for the `JPanel` container.

It is important to note that you should always check the Java documentation for the latest recommendations on how to use Java classes and methods. Also, when refactoring your code, you should consider testing it thoroughly to ensure that it still works as expected.
