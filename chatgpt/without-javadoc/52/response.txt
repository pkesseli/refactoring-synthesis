Sure, I'd be happy to help with that.

The `java.awt.Container.locate(int, int)` method is deprecated because it has been replaced with a more efficient method. Instead of using the `locate()` method, you should use the `getComponentAt(int, int)` method, which returns the component that lies at the specified coordinates.

Here is an example of how you can refactor your code to use the `getComponentAt()` method instead of the deprecated `locate()` method:

```
// Deprecated code using Container.locate(int, int)
Container container = ...;
int x = ...;
int y = ...;
Component component = container.locate(x, y);

// Refactored code using Container.getComponentAt(int, int)
Container container = ...;
int x = ...;
int y = ...;
Component component = container.getComponentAt(x, y);
```

In this example, we simply replaced the `locate()` method with `getComponentAt()`, which provides the same functionality without the use of a deprecated method.

Note that the `getComponentAt()` method is more efficient than the `locate()` method because it uses a bounding box optimization to quickly determine which component, if any, lies at the specified coordinates.
