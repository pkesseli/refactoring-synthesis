Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.awt.Container.minimumSize()` method.

Instead of using the deprecated method, you can use the `java.awt.Container.getMinimumSize()` method. Here's an example:

```java
// Deprecated code
Container container = new Container();
Dimension minimumSize = container.minimumSize();

// Refactored code
Container container = new Container();
Dimension minimumSize = container.getMinimumSize();
```

In the refactored code, we're simply replacing the deprecated `minimumSize()` method with the non-deprecated `getMinimumSize()` method. This should have the same functionality as the deprecated method, but with the added benefit of not being deprecated. 

Note that if you're using a newer version of Java, it's possible that `getMinimumSize()` may also be deprecated. In that case, you may need to find an alternative method or approach to achieve the same functionality.
