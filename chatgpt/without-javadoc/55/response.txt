Sure! Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor.equals(String)` method:

Before refactoring:
```java
DataFlavor flavor = ...;
if (flavor.equals(DataFlavor.stringFlavor.getMimeType())) {
    // Do something
}
```

After refactoring:
```java
DataFlavor flavor = ...;
if (flavor.isMimeTypeEqual(DataFlavor.stringFlavor.getMimeType())) {
    // Do something
}
```

In this refactored code, we're using the `isMimeTypeEqual(String)` method instead of the deprecated `equals(String)` method. The `isMimeTypeEqual` method performs the same function as the deprecated method, but it's not deprecated and is therefore a safer and more future-proof option.

Note that in order to use the `isMimeTypeEqual` method, you need to have a `DataFlavor` object to call it on. In the example above, I assumed that you already have a `DataFlavor` object (`flavor`) that you're working with. If you don't have a `DataFlavor` object yet and need to create one, you can use the `DataFlavor(String mimeType)` constructor to create a `DataFlavor` object with the specified MIME type.
