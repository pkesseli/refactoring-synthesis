Sure, here is an example of how you can refactor the deprecated method `java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor.normalizeMimeTypeParameter(String, String)`:

Before:

```
String parameter = DataFlavor.normalizeMimeTypeParameter("charset", "UTF-8");
```

After:

```
String parameter = "charset=UTF-8".toLowerCase();
```

In the above example, we are replacing the deprecated method with a simple string concatenation and conversion to lowercase. The `normalizeMimeTypeParameter()` method was used to create a string in the format "parameter=value", where the value was URL encoded. However, this functionality can be easily achieved by manually creating the string and lowercasing it, as shown in the refactored example. 

Note that this is just one possible refactoring, and the best approach may depend on the specific use case.
