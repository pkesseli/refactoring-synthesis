Sure! The `java.awt.Dialog.hide()` method has been deprecated since Java 1.5 and should no longer be used. Instead, you should use `java.awt.Dialog.setVisible(false)` to hide a dialog. Here's an example refactoring of code that uses the deprecated `hide()` method:

Before refactoring:

```
Dialog myDialog = new Dialog();
myDialog.setTitle("My Dialog");
myDialog.show();
myDialog.hide();
```

After refactoring:

```
Dialog myDialog = new Dialog();
myDialog.setTitle("My Dialog");
myDialog.setVisible(true);
myDialog.setVisible(false);
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `show()` method with the `setVisible(true)` method, and we've replaced the deprecated `hide()` method with `setVisible(false)`. These changes will ensure that our code continues to function properly without using deprecated methods.
