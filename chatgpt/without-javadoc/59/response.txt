Certainly! Here's an example of refactoring code that uses the deprecated method `java.awt.Dialog.show()`:

```
Dialog dialog = new Dialog(parent, "My Dialog", true);
dialog.setSize(400, 300);
dialog.show();
```

Here's a refactored version that uses the recommended method, `java.awt.Dialog.setVisible(boolean)`:

```
Dialog dialog = new Dialog(parent, "My Dialog", true);
dialog.setSize(400, 300);
dialog.setVisible(true);
```

The `setVisible()` method is recommended because it provides the same functionality as `show()`, but is not deprecated. By using the `setVisible()` method, you can avoid any potential issues that may arise from using a deprecated method in your code.
