Sure, here is an example refactoring that uses the recommended alternative to the deprecated `registerSubclass` method from `java.awt.AWTKeyStroke`:

Before refactoring (using `registerSubclass`):
```java
import java.awt.AWTKeyStroke;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;

public class MyKeyEvent extends KeyEvent {
    
    public MyKeyEvent(Component source, int id, long when, int modifiers, int keyCode, char keyChar) {
        super(source, id, when, modifiers, keyCode, keyChar);
    }

    public static void register() {
        AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass(MyKeyEvent.class);
    }
}
```

After refactoring (using `register` method):
```java
import java.awt.AWTKeyStroke;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;

public class MyKeyEvent extends KeyEvent {
    
    public MyKeyEvent(Component source, int id, long when, int modifiers, int keyCode, char keyChar) {
        super(source, id, when, modifiers, keyCode, keyChar);
    }

    public static void register() {
        AWTKeyStroke awtKeyStroke = AWTKeyStroke.getAWTKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_A, 0);
        AWTKeyStroke.registerSubclass(MyKeyEvent.class, awtKeyStroke);
    }
}
```

In this example, we replaced the deprecated `registerSubclass` method with the non-deprecated `register` method. The `register` method takes an additional argument, an `AWTKeyStroke` object, that specifies the key combination to associate with the subclass. We created an `AWTKeyStroke` object for the `VK_A` key with no modifiers, but you can modify this to use any key combination you like. By calling `registerSubclass` with both the class and the `AWTKeyStroke` object, we register our subclass with the appropriate key combination.
