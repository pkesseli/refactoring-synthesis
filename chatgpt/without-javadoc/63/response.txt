Sure, I can provide an example of how to refactor the deprecated `getMaxDecent()` method in Java's `FontMetrics` class.

Instead of using `getMaxDecent()`, you can use the `getDescent()` method, which provides the same functionality. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use `getDescent()` instead:

Before refactoring:

```
FontMetrics fm = ...; // obtain a FontMetrics object
int descent = fm.getMaxDecent();
```

After refactoring:

```
FontMetrics fm = ...; // obtain a FontMetrics object
int descent = fm.getDescent();
```

As you can see, the only change needed is to replace the deprecated `getMaxDecent()` method with `getDescent()`. This will ensure that your code continues to work correctly, even as Java evolves and changes over time.
