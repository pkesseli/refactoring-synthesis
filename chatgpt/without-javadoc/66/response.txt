The `finalize()` method in the `java.awt.Graphics` class has been deprecated, which means it is no longer recommended to use it in new code because it may be removed in a future version of Java. Instead, it is suggested to use other methods to accomplish the same functionality. Here's an example refactoring to replace the use of `finalize()` with a more appropriate method:

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class MyGraphics {
    private Graphics graphics;

    public MyGraphics() {
        graphics = new Graphics();
    }

    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        graphics.dispose();
        super.finalize();
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.awt.Graphics;
import java.awt.Graphics2D;

public class MyGraphics {
    private Graphics2D graphics;

    public MyGraphics() {
        graphics = (Graphics2D) getGraphics();
    }

    public void dispose() {
        graphics.dispose();
    }

    private Graphics getGraphics() {
        // TODO: create a Graphics object using appropriate method
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have replaced the use of `finalize()` with a new `dispose()` method. This method will be called explicitly by the user of the `MyGraphics` class when they no longer need the `graphics` object. Additionally, we have changed the type of the `graphics` object from `Graphics` to `Graphics2D`, since that is typically the more appropriate type to use when working with graphics.

The `getGraphics()` method is left as a TODO, since the appropriate method to use will depend on the specific use case. For example, if this code is running in a Swing application, we might call `getGraphics()` on a `JPanel` object to obtain a `Graphics` object that we can use for drawing.
