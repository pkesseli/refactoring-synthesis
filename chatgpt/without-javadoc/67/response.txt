Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.Graphics.getClipRect()` method:

```
// Old code using getClipRect():
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    Rectangle clipRect = g.getClipRect();
    // Use the clipRect for painting...
}

// Refactored code using getClipBounds() instead:
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    Rectangle clipRect = g.getClipBounds();
    // Use the clipRect for painting...
}
```

In this refactored code, we replace the deprecated `getClipRect()` method with the recommended replacement `getClipBounds()` method. Both methods return a `Rectangle` that represents the current clipping area of the `Graphics` object, but `getClipBounds()` is not deprecated and is the preferred way to obtain the clip bounds. 

This should resolve any deprecation warnings in your code and ensure that your code continues to function as expected.
