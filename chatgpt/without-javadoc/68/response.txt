Sure! Here's an example of how you could refactor code that uses the deprecated `java.awt.image.ColorModel.finalize()` method.

Before refactoring:

```java
public class ImageProcessor {

    private ColorModel colorModel;

    public ImageProcessor(ColorModel colorModel) {
        this.colorModel = colorModel;
    }

    public void finalize() {
        // Clean up resources
        colorModel.finalize();
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
public class ImageProcessor implements Closeable {

    private ColorModel colorModel;

    public ImageProcessor(ColorModel colorModel) {
        this.colorModel = colorModel;
    }

    @Override
    public void close() throws IOException {
        // Clean up resources
        colorModel = null;
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

In this refactored example, we've implemented the `Closeable` interface instead of overriding the `finalize()` method. The `close()` method of `Closeable` is called when the object is no longer needed, and we can use this method to clean up any resources used by the `ImageProcessor` object. 

We've also removed the call to `colorModel.finalize()`, which is now unnecessary because the object will be cleaned up in the `close()` method. Finally, we've set `colorModel` to `null` in the `close()` method to indicate that the object is no longer needed and can be garbage collected.
