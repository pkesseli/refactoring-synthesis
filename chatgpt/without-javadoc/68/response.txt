Sure, here is an example of how to refactor the use of `java.awt.image.ColorModel.finalize()` method:

Before:
```java
public class ImageProcessor {
    private ColorModel colorModel;
    
    public ImageProcessor() {
        colorModel = new ColorModel();
    }
    
    // Other methods...
    
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // Perform cleanup operations on colorModel
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

After:
```java
public class ImageProcessor {
    private ColorModel colorModel;
    
    public ImageProcessor() {
        colorModel = new ColorModel();
    }
    
    // Other methods...
    
    public void cleanup() {
        // Perform cleanup operations on colorModel
    }
    
    public void close() {
        cleanup();
    }
}
```

Explanation:

In the `ImageProcessor` class, `java.awt.image.ColorModel.finalize()` is used to perform cleanup operations on the `colorModel` object when it is garbage collected. However, this method is deprecated, and should not be used for cleanup purposes.

To refactor this, we can create a public `cleanup()` method that performs the same cleanup operations as the `finalize()` method. This method can be called explicitly by the client code to ensure proper cleanup. 

Additionally, we can create a `close()` method that simply calls the `cleanup()` method, as this is a common pattern in many Java classes.

By doing this, we have removed the use of the deprecated `finalize()` method and provided a clean and easy-to-use API for performing cleanup operations.
