Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the `java.awt.image.IndexColorModel.finalize()` method, which is deprecated in Java 9:

Before Refactoring:

```java
public class ImageProcessor {
    private IndexColorModel colorModel;

    public ImageProcessor(IndexColorModel colorModel) {
        this.colorModel = colorModel;
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            colorModel.finalize();
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}
```

After Refactoring:

```java
public class ImageProcessor {
    private IndexColorModel colorModel;

    public ImageProcessor(IndexColorModel colorModel) {
        this.colorModel = colorModel;
    }

    public void close() {
        colorModel = null;
    }
}
```

In this example, we removed the `finalize()` method and replaced it with a new `close()` method, which allows us to explicitly release any resources held by the `IndexColorModel` object. By setting `colorModel` to `null`, we allow the garbage collector to reclaim the memory used by the object. This way, we don't rely on the `finalize()` method to release resources, which is generally considered to be unreliable and unpredictable. 

To use this refactored code, we simply call the `close()` method when we're done with the `ImageProcessor` object. This ensures that any resources held by the `IndexColorModel` object are properly released.
