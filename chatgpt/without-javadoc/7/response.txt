Sure, I can show you an example of how to refactor the use of `java.awt.BorderLayout.addLayoutComponent(String, Component)` to avoid using the deprecated method. 

Here's an example of using the deprecated `addLayoutComponent` method to add a `JLabel` to a `JPanel` using a BorderLayout:

```java
JPanel panel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());
JLabel label = new JLabel("Hello, World!");
panel.add("North", label);
```

To refactor this code, we need to replace the use of the deprecated `addLayoutComponent` method with a recommended alternative method. The recommended method to use is `add(Component, Object)`. This method adds a component to the container with a given layout constraint. Here's how you can refactor the above code:

```java
JPanel panel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());
JLabel label = new JLabel("Hello, World!");
panel.add(label, BorderLayout.NORTH);
```

As you can see, we replaced the use of the deprecated `addLayoutComponent` method with the recommended `add(Component, Object)` method. We passed the `JLabel` object as the first parameter and the layout constraint as the second parameter. 

By using the `add(Component, Object)` method instead of the deprecated `addLayoutComponent` method, we have updated our code to use the latest recommended approach, which will ensure that our code will continue to work correctly in future versions of Java.
