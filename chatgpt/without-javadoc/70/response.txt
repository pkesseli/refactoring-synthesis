Sure, here's an example refactoring using the `concatenateTransform()` method in a deprecated `RenderContext` class in Java's AWT library:

Before refactoring:

```
RenderContext context = new RenderContext(new AffineTransform());
context.concatenateTransform(new AffineTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, x, y));
```

After refactoring:

```
AffineTransform transform = new AffineTransform();
transform.translate(x, y);
RenderContext context = new RenderContext(transform);
```

In the refactored code, we've replaced the `concatenateTransform()` method call with an equivalent `translate()` method call on a new `AffineTransform` object. This produces the same result as the original code without using the deprecated method.

Note that this is just one possible refactoring. Depending on the context of the code, there may be other ways to achieve the same functionality without using the deprecated method.
