Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor the deprecated `delItems(int, int)` method from the `java.awt.List` class:

Deprecated method signature:

```java
public void delItems(int start, int end)
```

Refactored method signature:

```java
public void removeItems(int start, int end)
```

Explanation:

The `delItems(int, int)` method is used to remove a range of items from a `List` component. However, this method has been deprecated since Java 1.1 and should be avoided. Instead, we can use the `remove(int, int)` method from the `java.util.List` interface which serves the same purpose.

Here's an example of how you can refactor code that uses `delItems(int, int)`:

```java
// Before refactoring
List myList = new List();
myList.add("Item 1");
myList.add("Item 2");
myList.add("Item 3");
myList.add("Item 4");
myList.delItems(1, 3);

// After refactoring
List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();
myList.add("Item 1");
myList.add("Item 2");
myList.add("Item 3");
myList.add("Item 4");
myList.subList(1, 4).clear();
```

In the refactored code, we replaced the deprecated `delItems(int, int)` method with the `subList(int, int).clear()` method which achieves the same result. We also updated the type of the `myList` variable to use the `ArrayList` implementation of the `List` interface for greater flexibility and functionality.
