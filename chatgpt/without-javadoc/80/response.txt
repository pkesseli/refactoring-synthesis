Sure, I can provide an example of refactoring the deprecated method java.awt.List.minimumSize().

The deprecated method java.awt.List.minimumSize() returns the minimum size needed to display this list. Instead, you can use the method java.awt.Component.getMinimumSize() to achieve the same functionality.

Here's an example of how to refactor your code:

Before refactoring:

```
import java.awt.List;

public class MyList extends List {
  
  public MyList() {
    // ...
  }
  
  public Dimension minimumSize() {
    return super.minimumSize();
  }
  
}
```

After refactoring:

```
import java.awt.List;
import java.awt.Component;

public class MyList extends List {
  
  public MyList() {
    // ...
  }
  
  @Override
  public Dimension getMinimumSize() {
    return super.getMinimumSize();
  }
  
}
```

As you can see, we replaced the deprecated method minimumSize() with getMinimumSize() and added the @Override annotation to indicate that we are overriding a method from the parent class. This change should not affect the behavior of your code and will make it more future-proof.
