Sure, here's an example of how you can refactor your code to use a recommended alternative to `java.awt.List.minimumSize(int)` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
List myList = new List();
Dimension dimension = myList.minimumSize(10); // deprecated method
```

After refactoring:

```java
List myList = new List();
myList.setPrototypeDisplayValue("0123456789"); // set the maximum width of the list items
Dimension dimension = myList.getPreferredSize(); // get the preferred size of the list
```

Explanation:
The `minimumSize(int)` method is deprecated because it has some limitations and does not always provide an accurate size. The recommended alternative is to set the maximum width of the list items using `setPrototypeDisplayValue()` and then get the preferred size of the list using `getPreferredSize()`. 

In the refactored code, we set the maximum width of the list items to 10 characters (which is the same as the parameter used in the deprecated method), by setting a prototype display value of "0123456789". Then we get the preferred size of the list by calling `getPreferredSize()`, which takes into account the maximum width we set and returns a more accurate size for the list.
