Sure, I can show you an example of how to refactor the deprecated `java.awt.List.preferredSize(int)` method.

Firstly, let's understand what the `preferredSize(int)` method does. This method returns the preferred size of the List component when it has the specified number of rows visible. The preferred size is the size at which the component would like to be displayed, but it's not a hard constraint.

Since this method is deprecated, the recommended way to obtain the preferred size of a component is by calling its `getPreferredSize()` method. However, since the `preferredSize(int)` method allows you to specify the number of rows visible, you may need to adjust the preferred size to account for a different number of rows.

Here's an example of how to refactor the deprecated `preferredSize(int)` method using `getPreferredSize()` and adjusting the size for a different number of rows:

```java
// Deprecated method
List myList = new List();
Dimension preferredSize = myList.preferredSize(5);

// Refactored method
List myList = new List();
Dimension preferredSize = myList.getPreferredSize();
preferredSize.height = myList.getPreferredSize().height * 5;
```

In the refactored code, we first obtain the preferred size of the List component by calling its `getPreferredSize()` method. Then, we adjust the height of the preferred size to account for a different number of rows by multiplying it by the number of rows we want to display (in this example, 5). The width of the preferred size remains unchanged.

By refactoring the code in this way, we ensure that we're using the recommended method for obtaining the preferred size of a component and still account for a different number of rows as needed.
