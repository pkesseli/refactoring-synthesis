Sure, here's an example of how you could refactor the deprecated `countMenus()` method in `java.awt.MenuBar`:

Original code:

```
MenuBar menuBar = new MenuBar();
// ...
int menuCount = menuBar.countMenus();
// ...
```

Refactored code:

```
MenuBar menuBar = new MenuBar();
// ...
int menuCount = getMenuCount(menuBar);
// ...

private int getMenuCount(MenuBar menuBar) {
    int count = 0;
    Menu[] menus = menuBar.getMenus();
    for (Menu menu : menus) {
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

In this refactored code, we've replaced the deprecated `countMenus()` method with a new method called `getMenuCount()`. This method takes a `MenuBar` object as an argument and returns the number of menus in the menu bar.

To implement `getMenuCount()`, we use the `getMenus()` method of the `MenuBar` class to get an array of all the menus in the menu bar. We then iterate through the array and increment a counter for each menu. Finally, we return the counter value as the total number of menus in the menu bar.

Note that this is just one possible refactoring approach. Depending on the specific needs of your application, you may need to implement a different solution. However, this example should give you an idea of how to refactor the deprecated `countMenus()` method.
