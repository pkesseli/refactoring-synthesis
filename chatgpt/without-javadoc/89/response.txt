Certainly, here is an example of how to refactor the deprecated `disable()` method in Java using the recommended alternative:

Before Refactoring:
```java
MenuItem menuItem = new MenuItem("Save");
menuItem.disable();
```

After Refactoring:
```java
MenuItem menuItem = new MenuItem("Save");
menuItem.setEnabled(false);
```

In the above refactored code, the `disable()` method has been replaced with the `setEnabled(false)` method. This method achieves the same functionality as `disable()`, which is to disable the menu item, but is not deprecated.

Note that you can also use the `setDisabledIcon(Icon icon)` method to change the icon displayed when a menu item is disabled, and the `setActionCommand(String command)` method to set the command string associated with the menu item, both of which are not deprecated.
