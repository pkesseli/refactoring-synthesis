Sure, I can provide an example of refactoring the use of the deprecated method `java.awt.MenuItem.enable()`. 

The `enable()` method was used to enable or disable a `MenuItem`. As this method is deprecated, we can replace it with a new method that achieves the same functionality.

Here's an example:

Before refactoring:

```java
MenuItem menuItem = new MenuItem("File");
menuItem.enable(false);
```

After refactoring:

```java
MenuItem menuItem = new MenuItem("File");
menuItem.setEnabled(false);
```

In the refactored code, we are using the `setEnabled()` method to disable the `MenuItem`. This is the recommended method to use instead of the deprecated `enable()` method.

Note: In some cases, the deprecated method may still be required for compatibility with older versions of Java. However, if you are using a newer version of Java, it's recommended to use the updated method.
