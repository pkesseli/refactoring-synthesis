Sure, here's an example of how to refactor the `java.awt.Polygon.inside​(int, int)` method, which is deprecated, to use the `java.awt.geom.Area.contains​(double x, double y)` method instead.

Original code using the deprecated method:

```java
Polygon polygon = new Polygon(xPoints, yPoints, numPoints);
boolean isInside = polygon.inside(x, y);
```

Refactored code using the recommended method:

```java
Polygon polygon = new Polygon(xPoints, yPoints, numPoints);
Area area = new Area(polygon);
boolean isInside = area.contains((double) x, (double) y);
```

Explanation:

In the refactored code, we first create a `Polygon` object using the input `xPoints`, `yPoints`, and `numPoints`. Then, we create an `Area` object from the `Polygon`. Finally, we use the `contains(double x, double y)` method of the `Area` object to check if the point `(x,y)` is inside the polygon.

Note that the `contains(double x, double y)` method takes double values as input, so we need to cast the integer `x` and `y` values to doubles using `(double) x` and `(double) y`.

By using the `Area.contains​(double x, double y)` method, we avoid using the deprecated `Polygon.inside(int x, int y)` method and ensure our code will continue to work with future versions of Java.
