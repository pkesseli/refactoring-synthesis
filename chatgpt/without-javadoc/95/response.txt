Sure, here's an example refactoring using the `contains(int x, int y)` method instead of the deprecated `inside(int x, int y)` method in Java's `Rectangle` class:

```
// Create a new Rectangle object with dimensions (0, 0, 100, 100)
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100);

// Check if point (50, 50) is inside the rectangle using the deprecated inside() method
if (rect.inside(50, 50)) {
    System.out.println("Point (50, 50) is inside the rectangle.");
}

// Refactored code using contains() method instead of inside() method
if (rect.contains(50, 50)) {
    System.out.println("Point (50, 50) is inside the rectangle.");
}
```

In the refactored code, we simply replaced the `inside()` method with the `contains()` method. The `contains()` method is not deprecated and performs the same function as the `inside()` method.
