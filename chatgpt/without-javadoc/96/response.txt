Sure, here's an example of how to refactor code that uses the deprecated method `java.awt.Rectangle.move(int, int)`:

Before refactoring:

```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100);
rect.move(20, 20);
```

After refactoring:

```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100);
rect.setLocation(rect.x + 20, rect.y + 20);
```

In the refactored code, we use the `setLocation(int, int)` method instead of the deprecated `move(int, int)` method to change the position of the rectangle. We calculate the new location of the rectangle by adding the specified values to its current x and y coordinates. 

Note that `setLocation(int, int)` also updates the position of the rectangle's bounding box.
