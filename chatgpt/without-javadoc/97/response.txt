Sure, here's an example refactoring that uses the recommended alternative to the `java.awt.Rectangle.reshape` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10, 10, 50, 50);
rect.reshape(20, 20, 60, 60);
```

After refactoring:

```java
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(20, 20, 60, 60);
```

Explanation:

The `reshape` method in the `java.awt.Rectangle` class has been deprecated since Java 1.2, and the recommended alternative is to create a new `Rectangle` object with the desired values. 

In the original code, `rect` is created with initial values of (10, 10, 50, 50), and then the `reshape` method is called to change its values to (20, 20, 60, 60). 

In the refactored code, a new `Rectangle` object is created with the desired values of (20, 20, 60, 60). This achieves the same result as the original code, but without using the deprecated method.
