Sure, here's an example refactoring that addresses the deprecation of the `java.awt.Scrollbar.getLineIncrement()` method:

Before refactoring:

```java
Scrollbar scrollbar = new Scrollbar();
int lineIncrement = scrollbar.getLineIncrement();
```

After refactoring:

```java
Scrollbar scrollbar = new Scrollbar();
AdjustmentListener listener = new AdjustmentListener() {
    @Override
    public void adjustmentValueChanged(AdjustmentEvent e) {
        int value = e.getValue();
        int visibleAmount = scrollbar.getVisibleAmount();
        int maximum = scrollbar.getMaximum();
        int minimum = scrollbar.getMinimum();
        int range = maximum - minimum;
        int lineIncrement = range / visibleAmount;
    }
};
scrollbar.addAdjustmentListener(listener);
```

Explanation:
Instead of using the deprecated `getLineIncrement()` method, we can calculate the line increment value by adding an `AdjustmentListener` to the scrollbar and computing the value based on the scrollbar's current state. In the refactored code, the listener calculates the line increment by dividing the range of the scrollbar (the difference between the minimum and maximum values) by the visible amount of the scrollbar. This is a similar approach to what `getLineIncrement()` would do internally.

Note that this is just one possible refactoring, and the exact approach may depend on the specific use case and requirements of the code.
