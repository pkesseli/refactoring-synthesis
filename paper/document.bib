  abstract  = {Context The automated identification of code fragments characterized by common design flaws (or �code smells�) that can be handled through refactoring, fosters refactoring activities, especially in large code bases where multiple developers are engaged without a detailed view on the whole system. Automated refactoring to design patterns enables significant contributions to design quality even from developers with little experience on the use of the required patterns. Objective This work targets the automated identification of refactoring opportunities to the Strategy design pattern and the elimination through polymorphism of respective �code smells� that are related to extensive use of complex conditional statements. Method An algorithm is introduced for the automated identification of refactoring opportunities to the Strategy design pattern. Suggested refactorings comprise conditional statements that are characterized by analogies to the Strategy design pattern, in terms of the purpose and selection mode of strategies. Moreover, this work specifies the procedure for refactoring to Strategy the identified conditional statements. For special cases of these statements, a technique is proposed for total replacement of conditional logic with method calls of appropriate concrete Strategy instances. The identification algorithm and the refactoring procedure are implemented and integrated in the \{JDeodorant\} Eclipse plug-in. The method is evaluated on a set of Java projects, in terms of quality of the suggested refactorings and run-time efficiency. The relevance of the identified refactoring opportunities is verified by expert software engineers. Results The identification algorithm recalled, from the projects used during evaluation, many of the refactoring candidates that were identified by the expert software engineers. Its execution time on projects of varying size confirmed the run-time efficiency of this method. Conclusion The proposed method for automated refactoring to Strategy contributes to simplification of conditional statements. Moreover, it enhances system extensibility through the Strategy design pattern.}

  abstract = {Code generation models based on the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm have been increasingly attempted by both academia and industry, resulting in well-known industrial models such as Codex, CodeGen, and PanGu-Coder. To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, multiple existing benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval and AiXBench) are proposed, including only cases of generating a standalone function, i.e., a function that may invoke or access only built-in functions and standard libraries. However, non-standalone functions, which typically are not included in the existing benchmarks, constitute more than 70\% of the functions in popular open-source projects, and evaluating models' effectiveness on standalone functions cannot reflect these models' effectiveness on pragmatic code generation scenarios (i.e., code generation for real settings of open source or proprietary code).To help bridge the preceding gap, in this paper, we propose a benchmark named CoderEval, consisting of 230 Python and 230 Java code generation tasks carefully curated from popular real-world open-source projects and a self-contained execution platform to automatically assess the functional correctness of generated code. CoderEval supports code generation tasks from six levels of context dependency, where context refers to code elements such as types, APIs, variables, and consts defined outside the function under generation but within the dependent third-party libraries, current class, file, or project. CoderEval can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of models in generating code beyond only standalone functions. By evaluating three state-of-the-art code generation models (CodeGen, PanGu-Coder, and ChatGPT) on CoderEval and HumanEval, we find that the effectiveness of these models in generating standalone functions is substantially higher than that in generating non-standalone functions. Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further improve a model's effectiveness by leveraging contextual information for pragmatic code generation.},

  abstract = {Recently, many large language models (LLMs) have been proposed, showing advanced proficiency in code generation. Meanwhile, many efforts have been dedicated to evaluating LLMs on code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval. Although being very helpful for comparing different LLMs, existing evaluation focuses on a simple code generation scenario (i.e., function-level or statement-level code generation), which mainly asks LLMs to generate one single code unit (e.g., a function or a statement) for the given natural language description. Such evaluation focuses on generating independent and often small-scale code units, thus leaving it unclear how LLMs perform in real-world software development scenarios.To fill this knowledge gap, we make the first attempt to evaluate LLMs in a more challenging code generation scenario, i.e., class-level code generation. Compared with existing code generation benchmarks, it better reflects real-world software development scenarios due to it comprising broader contextual dependencies and multiple, interdependent units of code. We first manually construct the first class-level code generation benchmark ClassEval of 100 class-level Python code generation tasks with approximately 500 person-hours. Based on the new benchmark ClassEval, we then perform the first study of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs on class-level code generation. Based on our results, we find that all LLMs perform much worse on class-level code generation compared to the method-level. While GPT models still dominate other LLMs on class-level code generation, the performance rankings of other models on method-level code generation no longer holds for class-level code generation. Besides, most models (except GPT models) perform better when generating the class method by method; and they have the limited ability of generating dependent code. Based on our findings, we call for software engineering (SE) researchers' expertise to build more LLM benchmarks based on practical and complicated software development scenarios.},

  abstract = {Pretrained models for code have exhibited promising performance across various code-related tasks, such as code summarization, code completion, code translation, and bug detection. However, despite their success, the majority of current models still represent code as a token sequence, which may not adequately capture the essence of the underlying code structure.In this work, we propose GrammarT5, a grammar-integrated encoder-decoder pretrained neural model for code. GrammarT5 employs a novel grammar-integrated representation, Tokenized Grammar Rule Sequence (TGRS), for code. TGRS is constructed based on the grammar rule sequence utilized in syntax-guided code generation and integrates syntax information with code tokens within an appropriate input length. Furthermore, we suggest attaching language flags to help GrammarT5 differentiate between grammar rules of various programming languages. Finally, we introduce two novel pretraining tasks---Edge Prediction (EP), and Sub-Tree Prediction (STP) to learn syntactic information.Experiments were conducted on five code-related tasks using eleven datasets, demonstrating that GrammarT5 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on most tasks in comparison to models of the same scale. Additionally, the paper illustrates that the proposed pretraining tasks and language flags can enhance GrammarT5 to better capture the syntax and semantics of code.},

  abstract = {Transformer-based language models for automatic code completion have shown great promise so far, yet the evaluation of these models rarely uses real data. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative assessments of three public code language models when completing real-world code. We first developed an open-source IDE extension, Code4Me, for the online evaluation of the models. We collected real auto-completion usage data for over a year from more than 1200 users, resulting in over 600K valid completions. These models were then evaluated using six standard metrics across twelve programming languages. Next, we conducted a qualitative study of 1690 real-world completion requests to identify the reasons behind the poor model performance. A comparative analysis of the models&#x27; performance in online and offline settings was also performed, using benchmark synthetic datasets and two masking strategies. Our findings suggest that while developers utilize code completion across various languages, the best results are achieved for mainstream languages such as Python and Java. InCoder outperformed the other models across all programming languages, highlighting the significance of training data and objectives. Our study also revealed that offline evaluations do not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Upon qualitative analysis of the models&#x27; predictions, we found that 66.3% of failures were due to models&#x27; limitations, 24.4% occurred due to inappropriate model usage in a development context, and 9.3% were valid requests that developers overwrote. Given these findings, we propose several strategies to overcome the current limitations. These include refining training objectives, improving resilience to typographical errors, adopting hybrid approaches, and enhancing implementations and usability.},

  abstract = {Code translation aims to convert source code from one programming language (PL) to another. Given the promising abilities of large language models (LLMs) in code synthesis, researchers are exploring their potential to automate code translation. The prerequisite for advancing the state of LLM-based code translation is to understand their promises and limitations over existing techniques. To that end, we present a large-scale empirical study to investigate the ability of general LLMs and code LLMs for code translation across pairs of different languages, including C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our study, which involves the translation of 1,700 code samples from three benchmarks and two real-world projects, reveals that LLMs are yet to be reliably used to automate code translation---with correct translations ranging from 2.1\% to 47.3\% for the studied LLMs. Further manual investigation of unsuccessful translations identifies 15 categories of translation bugs. We also compare LLM-based code translation with traditional non-LLM-based approaches. Our analysis shows that these two classes of techniques have their own strengths and weaknesses. Finally, insights from our study suggest that providing more context to LLMs during translation can help them produce better results. To that end, we propose a prompt-crafting approach based on the symptoms of erroneous translations; this improves the performance of LLM-based code translation by 5.5\% on average. Our study is the first of its kind, in terms of scale and breadth, that provides insights into the current limitations of LLMs in code translation and opportunities for improving them. Our dataset---consisting of 1,700 code samples in five PLs with 10K+ tests, 43K+ translated code, 1,748 manually labeled bugs, and 1,365 bug-fix pairs---can help drive research in this area.},

In this paper, we introduce CodeGeeX, a multilingual model with 13 billion parameters for code generation. CodeGeeX is pre-trained on 850 billion tokens of 23 programming languages as of June 2022. Our extensive experiments suggest that CodeGeeX outperforms multilingual code models of similar scale for both the tasks of code generation and translation on HumanEval-X. Building upon HumanEval (Python only), we develop the HumanEval-X benchmark for evaluating multilingual models by hand-writing the solutions in C++, Java, JavaScript, and Go. In addition, we build CodeGeeX-based extensions on Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Cloud Studio, generating 8 billion tokens for tens of thousands of active users per week. Our user study demonstrates that CodeGeeX can help to increase coding efficiency for 83.4\% of its users. Finally, CodeGeeX is publicly accessible since Sep. 2022, we open-sourced its code, model weights, API, extensions, and HumanEval-X at https://github.com/THUDM/CodeGeeX.},

  abstract = {The advent of large language models trained on code (code LLMs) has led to significant progress in language-to-code generation. State-of-the-art approaches in this area combine LLM decoding with sample pruning and reranking using test cases or heuristics based on the execution results. However, it is challenging to obtain test cases for many real-world language-to-code applications, and heuristics cannot well capture the semantic features of the execution results, such as data type and value range, which often indicates the correctness of the program. In this work, we propose LEVER, a simple approach to improve language-to-code generation by learning to verify the generated programs with their execution results. Specifically, we train verifiers to determine whether a program sampled from the LLMs is correct or not based on the natural language input, the program itself and its execution results. The sampled programs are reranked by combining the verification score with the LLM generation probability, and marginalizing over programs with the same execution results. On four datasets across the domains of table QA, math QA and basic Python programming, LEVER consistently improves over the base code LLMs(4.6\% to 10.9\% with code-davinci-002) and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them.},

Across three types of explanations and 19 programming languages constructed from the MultiPL-E dataset, we find the explanations to be particularly effective in the zero-shot case, improving performance by 12{\%} on average. Improvements with natural language explanations are particularly pronounced on difficult programs. We release our dataset, code, and canonical solutions in all 19 languages.",
