Review A
Q1. What do the generators look like? Please provide the generators you used for synthesis and verification.

Review B
Q1: What were your refactorings evaluated on?
Q2: How does your tool work? Is it a plugin that will just do the refactorings automatically? How the unsound cases would be handled? Would one need to manually accept each and every refactoring?
Q3: How practical is your approach with regards to manual refactorings and/or automated change pattern suggestions etc.?

Review C
Q1: Did the authors manually verify the soundness reported in Tables 1 and 2?
- Yes.
Q2: How good are the automatic refactorings proposed by this tool?
Q3: Why 500 inputs, and not 250 or 5000? Would more/less inputs affect the output of the tool?
- We tried fuzzing additional inputs up to 2500, but they did not improve results.
Q4: Why 5 minutes, and not 30 minutes or 24h? Would shorter/longer runs affect the output of the tool?
- We tried alternative runtimes up to 15 minutes, but they did not improve results.
Q5: L567: Don't all Java objects inherit from java.lang.Object?
- We meant to say that we only consider class types which *directly* inherit from Object.
