The method `getCharacterStream` is not related to `CounterMonitorMBean` or its functionality. It's likely that the deprecation comment is incorrect or refers to a different context.\n\nThe `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` method in `CounterMonitorMBean` is used to retrieve the timestamp of the most recently derived gauge. If it's deprecated, you would typically look for a replacement method within the same class or interface that provides the same or similar functionality.\n\nHowever, without a correct replacement method specified in the deprecation comment, it's not possible to provide a direct code refactoring. You would need to consult the official documentation or API changes for `CounterMonitorMBean` to find the correct method to use as a replacement.\n\nIf the deprecation comment is indeed incorrect and there is no direct replacement, you might have to continue using `getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp()` until a proper alternative is provided, or refactor your code to avoid the need for this method altogether, which would require a more in-depth understanding of your application's requirements and the available JMX monitoring alternatives.;" , "javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean" , "getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp") , anyOf (contains ("getDerivedGaugeTimeStamp"))) ;
