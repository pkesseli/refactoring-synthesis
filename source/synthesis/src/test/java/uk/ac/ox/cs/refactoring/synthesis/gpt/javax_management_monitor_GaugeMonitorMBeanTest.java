The `getDerivedGauge()` method in `GaugeMonitorMBean` is for obtaining the last measured value from a GaugeMonitor, which is a JMX monitor type, while `InputVerifier` is a Swing class for validating user input in GUI components.\n\nTo refactor the code correctly, you would need to look for the new recommended method to obtain the derived gauge value in the context of JMX monitoring. However, without the correct deprecation notice or the updated API documentation, it's not possible to provide a code-only solution.\n\nIf the `getDerivedGauge()` method is indeed deprecated, you should consult the updated JMX monitoring documentation or the migration guide provided by the library or framework you are using to find the recommended replacement method.;" , "javax.management.monitor.GaugeMonitorMBean" , "getDerivedGauge") , anyOf (contains ("getDerivedGauge"))) ;
