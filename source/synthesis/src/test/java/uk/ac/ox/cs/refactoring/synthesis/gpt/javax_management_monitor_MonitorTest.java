The former is used in JMX (Java Management Extensions) to monitor MBeans, while the latter is a method in the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) used to enable or disable UI components.\n\nIf `getObservedObject()` is indeed deprecated and you need to refactor the code to achieve similar functionality, you would typically use an alternative method provided by the `Monitor` class. However, without the correct deprecation details, it's not possible to provide a precise replacement.\n\nIf you are looking to replace the usage of `getObservedObject()` with a non-deprecated method, you would typically look for a method that retrieves the observed MBean object. However, without the correct information on the replacement method, I cannot provide a code snippet.\n\nPlease check the official Java documentation for the correct replacement method for `getObservedObject()`. If a new method has been introduced in the `Monitor` class to replace `getObservedObject()`, you would use that method instead. If no such method exists, you might need to reconsider the design of your monitoring setup or continue using the deprecated method until an alternative is provided.;" , "javax.management.monitor.Monitor" , "getObservedObject") , anyOf (contains ("getObservedObjects"))) ;
