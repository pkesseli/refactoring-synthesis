It's possible that the deprecation notice is for a different method or there has been some mistake.\n\nHowever, if `drawEchoCharacter` were truly deprecated and assuming there is a new method to use (which is not provided in the question), you would typically replace the call to the deprecated method with a call to the new method. Since no new method for drawing echo characters is provided, I cannot give you a direct replacement.\n\nIf you are looking to simply draw echo characters and manage it yourself, you might override the `paint` method of the component that uses the `PasswordView`, but without the correct context or a new method to replace `drawEchoCharacter`, I cannot provide a refactored code snippet.\n\nIf you have the correct new method to use, you would replace the old method call with the new one, ensuring you pass the correct parameters as required by the new method's signature.;" , "javax.swing.text.PasswordView" , "drawEchoCharacter" , "java.awt.Graphics" , "int" , "int" , "char") , anyOf (contains ("drawEchoCharacter"))) ;
