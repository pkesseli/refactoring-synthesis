The comment about \"stream-based methods\" and \"RFC 8353\" is more likely related to security or network protocols, not to drawing lines in a Swing component.\n\nThe `javax.swing.text.PlainView.drawLine` method is not deprecated in the standard Java API, and the method you should use to replace it would not be `GSSContext.initSecContext`. It seems there might be a mix-up in the information provided.\n\nIf you are indeed looking to refactor code that uses a deprecated method for drawing lines in a Swing component, you would typically replace it with direct calls to the `Graphics` object's drawing methods. However, since `PlainView.drawLine` is not deprecated, you can continue to use it as is.\n\nIf you have a different method that is deprecated and you need to refactor it, please provide the correct method name and its deprecation details. Otherwise, the code fragment you've provided does not need refactoring based on the current Java API as of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023.;" , "javax.swing.text.PlainView" , "drawLine" , "int" , "java.awt.Graphics" , "int" , "int") , anyOf (contains ("drawLine"))) ;
